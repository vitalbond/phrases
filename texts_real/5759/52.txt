<div><p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that the <strong>first beta of WordPress 3.9</strong> is now available for testing.</p>
<p>WordPress 3.9 is due out next month &mdash; but in order to hit that goal, <strong>we need your help</strong> testing all of the goodies we&rsquo;ve added:</p>
<ul><li>We updated TinyMCE, the software powering the visual editor, to the latest version. Be on the lookout for cleaner markup. Also try the new paste handling &mdash; if you paste in a block of text from Microsoft Word, for example, it will no longer come out terrible. (The &ldquo;Paste from Word&rdquo; button you probably never noticed has been removed.) It&rsquo;s possible some plugins that added stuff to the visual editor (like a new toolbar button) no longer work, so we&rsquo;d like to hear about them (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">#24067</a>). (And be sure to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112">#27112</a>) We&rsquo;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785">#21785</a>)</li>
<li>We brought 3.8&prime;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check&nbsp;it out! (<a title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055">#27055</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a&nbsp;live&nbsp;preview in the editor. Upload some photos and insert a gallery to see this in action. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959">#26959</a>)</li>
<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them. It can be a bit finicky, so try it and help us work out the kinks. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845">#19845</a>)</li>
<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to make changes to an image after you insert it into a post (<a class="closed" title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24409">#24409</a>) and you no longer get kicked to a new window when you need to crop or rotate an image (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21811">#21811</a>).</li>
<li>New <strong>audio/video playlists</strong>. Upload a few audio or video files to test these. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26631">#26631</a>)</li>
</ul><p><strong>If you think you&rsquo;ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We&rsquo;d love to hear from you! If you&rsquo;re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.9">everything we&rsquo;ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don&rsquo;t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.9, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you&rsquo;ll want &ldquo;bleeding edge nightlies&rdquo;). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<hr><p><strong>DEVELOPERS!</strong> Hello! There&rsquo;s lots for you, too.</p>
<p><strong>Please test your plugins and themes!</strong> There&rsquo;s a lot of great stuff under the hood in 3.9 and we hope to blog a bit about them in the coming days. If you haven&rsquo;t been reading the awesome <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/">weekly summaries</a>&nbsp;on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">main core development blog</a>, that&rsquo;s a great place to start. (You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>
<ul><li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see&nbsp;<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003">#27003</a>.</li>
<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&rsquo;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&rsquo;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>
<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272">#25272</a>).</li>
<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799">#26799</a>). Also Masonry 3 (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25351">#25351</a>), PHPMailer (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25560">#25560</a>), Plupload (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25663">#25663</a>), and TinyMCE (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">#24067</a>).</li>
<li>TinyMCE 4.0 is a <em>major</em> update. Please see TinyMCE&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x">upgrade guide</a> and our <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">implementation ticket</a> for more. If you have any questions or problems, please <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">open a thread in the support forums</a>.</li>
</ul><p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em><em>Lots of improvements<br>
Little things go a long way</em><br>
Please test beta one<br></em></p></div>
