<p>The <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">South by Southwest Interactive Festival</a> (SXSW) holds a special place in the history and heart of WordPress. Though the conference has changed in the years since I first met Matt in the hallway in 2003 &#8212; before WordPress even had a name &#8212; it&#8217;s still arguably one of the most influential events in our industry, and we&#8217;ll be there again this year. Will we see you there?</p>
<h3>Booth</h3>
<p>There will be a <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/booth/">WordPress booth at the SXSW trade show</a> March 12-15. Our booth was packed to overflowing last year as we helped people with their blogs and gave away WordPress swag, so this year we&#8217;ll have more space to meet as many of you as possible. Stop by if you need a helping hand with your site, or just to say hi. We&#8217;ll also have buttons, stickers, and t-shirts again this year.</p>
<h3>Party</h3>
<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/">WordPress party</a> will be hosted by the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org">WordPress Foundation</a> on Monday, March 12 from 6-9pm. Space is limited, so make sure you <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/">RSVP</a> (no SXSW badge is required). The party this year will be at the <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/thehouse/">Buzzmedia Pure Volume House</a>, and the story of how we hooked up with them is pretty cool.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once upon a time, David Wang had a business called Buzzmedia in Malaysia, with the twitter username @buzzmedia. When David changed gears and started <a href="http://clickwp.com/">ClickWP</a>, a WordPress support business, he stopped going by the Buzzmedia name. In the U.S., a company also called Buzzmedia wished it had that Twitter username, and asked if they could have it since David wasn&#8217;t going to use it anymore.</p>
<p>David, feeling the WordPress community love, said he would give them the name, and suggested they do something in return for the WordPress Foundation. So, everyone talked to everyone else and it worked out that Buzzmedia was willing to donate a fantastic venue for this year&#8217;s party as well as covering the bar.</p>
<p>In the end, the Foundation got a great SXSW party, Buzzmedia got their twitter username, and David got the warm glow of having used his power for the good of the WordPress community, and they all lived happily ever after.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seriously, though, the PureVolume House is always a great SXSW venue, so thank you David and Buzzmedia for your generosity! We&#8217;ll have drinks and snacks and a few hundred WordPress-loving partygoers, so you know it will be a good time. Kind of like a WordCamp afterparty without all the work of a WordCamp. <img src='http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The venue can hold 500 people, and based on last year, we&#8217;ll hit that pretty quickly. The one requirement is that you use WordPress. On the RSVP form, you will be asked to enter the URL of your WordPress-powered site (if you have more than one, just pick your main site). If you fill in this field with something other than what&#8217;s requested (such as &#8220;N/A&#8221; or putting in a fake url) your RSVP may be deleted, so please make sure to enter your real site.<br />
