<div><p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce the availability of WordPress 3.7 Beta 1.</p>
<p>For WordPress 3.7 we decided to shorten the development cycle and focus on a few key improvements. We plan to release the final product in October, and then follow it in December with a jam-packed WordPress 3.8 release, which is already in development. Some of the best stuff in WordPress 3.7 is subtle &mdash; by design! So let&rsquo;s walk through what we&rsquo;d love for you to test, just in time for the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic, background updates.</strong>&nbsp;3.7 Beta 1 will keep itself updated. That&rsquo;s right &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be updated each night to the newest development build, and eventually to Beta 2. We&rsquo;re working to provide as many installs as possible with fast updates to security releases of WordPress &mdash; and you can help us test by just installing Beta 1 on your server and seeing how it works!</p>
<p>When you go to&nbsp;<strong>Dashboard &rarr; Updates</strong>, you&rsquo;ll see a note letting you know whether your install is working for automatic updates. There are a few situations where WordPress can&rsquo;t reliably and securely update itself. But if it can, you&rsquo;ll get an email (sent to the &lsquo;Admin Email&rsquo; on the General Settings page) after each update letting you know what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. If it worked, great! If something failed, the email will suggest you make a post in the support forums or create a bug report.</p>
<p>Here are some other things you should test out:</p>
<ul><li>If you&rsquo;re running&nbsp;<strong>WordPress in another language</strong>, we&rsquo;ll automatically download any available translations for official WordPress importers and the default themes. (More to come here.)</li>
<li>Our&nbsp;<strong>password meter</strong>&nbsp;got a whole lot better, thanks to Dropbox&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/">zxcvbn</a>&nbsp;library. Again, subtle but effective. Strong passwords are very important!</li>
<li><strong>Search results</strong>&nbsp;are now&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/25632">ordered by relevance</a>, rather than just by date. When your keywords match post titles and not just content, they&rsquo;ll be pushed to the top.</li>
<li>Developers should check out the new&nbsp;<strong>advanced date queries</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>WP_Query</code>. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18694">#18694</a>)</li>
</ul><p><strong>This software is still in development</strong>, so we don&rsquo;t recommend you run it on a production site. I&rsquo;d suggest setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.7, try the&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you&rsquo;ll want &ldquo;bleeding edge nightlies&rdquo;). Or you can&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.7-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>
<p>As always,&nbsp;<strong>if you think you&rsquo;ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a>&nbsp;in the support forums. Or, if you&rsquo;re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report,&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">a list of known bugs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.7">everything we&rsquo;ve fixed</a>&nbsp;so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
