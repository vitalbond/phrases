<p>Howdy, folks! Another week, another beta. Since we released Beta 1 last week, we&#8217;ve committed more than 60 bug fixes and feature adjustments based on testing and feedback. If you&#8217;ve been testing Beta 1, please update to Beta 2 to make sure things are still working for you. If you are a theme or plugin author and have not yet started testing your code against the 3.4 beta, now&#8217;s the perfect time to start. And as always, if you find any bugs, let us know! Full details on testing and bug reporting can be found in <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/04/wordpress-3-4-beta-1/" title="WordPress 3.4 Beta 1">last week&#8217;s Beta 1 post</a>.</p>
