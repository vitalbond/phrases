<div><p>WordPress 4.0 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.0, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.0 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we’ve been working on:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Previews of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">embedding via URLs</a></strong> in the visual editor and the “Insert from URL” tab in the media modal. Try pasting a URL (such as a <a href="http://wordpress.tv/">WordPress.tv</a> or YouTube video) onto its own line in the visual editor. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28195">#28195</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15490">#15490</a>)</li>
<li>The <strong>Media Library</strong> now has a “grid” view in addition to the existing list view. Clicking on an item takes you into a modal where you can see a larger preview and edit information about that attachment, and you can navigate between items right from the modal without closing it. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24716">#24716</a>)</li>
<li>We’re freshening up the <strong>plugin install experience</strong>. You’ll see some early visual changes as well as more information when searching for plugins and viewing details. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28785">#28785</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27440">#27440</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Selecting a language</strong> when you run the installation process. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28577">#28577</a>)</li>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> intelligently resizes and its top and bottom bars pin when needed. Browsers don’t like to agree on where to put things like cursors, so if you find a bug here, please also let us know your browser and operating system. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28328">#28328</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve made some improvements to how your keyboard and cursor interact with <strong>TinyMCE views</strong> such as the gallery preview. Much like the editor resizing and scrolling improvements, knowing about your setup is particularly important for bug reports here. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28595">#28595</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Widgets in the Customizer</strong> are now loaded in a separate panel. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27406">#27406</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also made some changes to some <strong>formatting</strong> functions, so if you see quotes curling in the wrong direction, please file a bug report.</li>
</ul><p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&#38;group=component&#38;milestone=4.0">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p><strong>Developers:</strong> Never fear, we haven’t forgotten you. There’s plenty for you, too – more on that in upcoming posts. In the meantime, check out the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/07/08/customizer-improvements-in-4-0/#customizer-panels">API for panels in the Customizer</a>.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
