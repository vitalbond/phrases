<div><p>The first release candidate for WordPress 3.7 is now available!</p>
<p>In RC 1, we&rsquo;ve made some adjustments to the update process to make it more reliable than ever.&nbsp;We hope to ship WordPress 3.7 <em>next week</em>, but we need your help to get there.&nbsp;If you haven&rsquo;t tested 3.7 yet, there&rsquo;s no time like the present. (Please, not on a production site, unless you&rsquo;re adventurous.)</p>
<p>WordPress 3.7 introduces <strong>automatic background updates</strong> for security and minor releases (like updating from 3.7 to 3.7.1). These are really easy to test &nbsp;&mdash; RC 1 will update every 12 hours or so to the latest development version, and then email you the results. (You may get two emails: one for debugging, and one all users of 3.7 will receive.)&nbsp;If something went wrong, you can report it.</p>
<p><strong>Think you&rsquo;ve found a bug?&nbsp;</strong>Please post to the&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>. If any known issues come up, you&rsquo;ll be able to&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">find them here</a>.</p>
<p>To test WordPress 3.7 RC1, try the&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you&rsquo;ll want &ldquo;bleeding edge nightlies&rdquo;). Or you can&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.7-RC1.zip">download the release candidate here</a>&nbsp;(zip).&nbsp;If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about what&rsquo;s new in WordPress 3.7, visit the awesome About screen in your dashboard (<strong><img alt="" src="http://core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/3.6/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/wordpress.png">&nbsp;&rarr; About</strong>&nbsp;in the toolbar). There, you can also see if your install is eligible for background updates.&nbsp;WordPress won&rsquo;t automatically update,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re using version control like Subversion or Git.</p>
<p><strong>Developers,</strong>&nbsp;please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 3.7, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can figure it out before the final release. Make sure you post any issues to the support forums.</p>
