If you&rsquo;re a WordPress user, developer, or business, we want your feedback. Just like previous years, we&rsquo;ll share the data at the upcoming <a href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco</a> (WCSF). Results will also be sent to each survey respondent.</p>
<p>It only takes a few minutes to <a href="http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2013">fill out the survey</a>, which will provide an overview of how people use WordPress.</p>
<p>If you missed past State of the Word keynotes, be sure to check out them out for survey results from <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/08/state-of-the-word/">2011</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2012/08/state-of-the-word-2012/">2012</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of WCSF, if you didn&rsquo;t get a ticket or are too far away to attend, you can still <a href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/tickets/">get a ticket for the live stream</a>! Watch the live video stream from the comfort of your home on July 26 and 27; WCSF t-shirt, or any shirt, optional.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there.</p></div>
