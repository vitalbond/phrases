<div><p>Release candidate 2 of WordPress 3.8 is <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.8-RC2.zip">now available for download</a>. This is the last pre-release, and we expect it to be effectively identical to what&rsquo;s officially released to the public on Thursday.</p>
<p>This means if you are a plugin or theme developer, start your engines! (If they&rsquo;re not going already.) Lots of admin code has changed so it&rsquo;s especially important to see if your plugin works well within the new admin design and layout, and update <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/readme.txt">the &ldquo;Tested up to:&rdquo; part of your plugin readme.txt</a>.</p>
<p>If there is something in your plugin that you&rsquo;re unable to fix, or if you think you&rsquo;ve found a bug, join us <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC">in #wordpress-dev in IRC</a>, especially if you&rsquo;re able to join during the dev chat on Wednesday, or post in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">alpha/beta forum</a>. The developers and designers who worked on this release are happy to help anyone update their code before the 3.8 release.</p>
<p>Happy hacking, everybody!</p></div>
