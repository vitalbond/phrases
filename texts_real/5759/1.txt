<p>The first release candidate (RC1) for WordPress 3.4 is now available.</p>
<p>An RC comes after the beta period and before final release. We think we&#8217;re done, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ve missed something. So if you haven’t tested WordPress 3.4 yet, now is the time! Please though, not on your live site unless you’re adventurous.</p>
<p>With more than <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.4">500 tickets closed</a>, there are quite a few changes. <strong>Plugin and theme authors,</strong> please test your plugins and themes now, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can figure it out before the final release.</p>
<p>If you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, please post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>. If any known issues crop up, you’ll be able to <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">find them here</a>.</p>
