<div><p>The first release candidate for WordPress 4.0 is now available!</p>
<p>In RC 1, we’ve made refinements to what we’ve been working on for this release. Check out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2014/07/wordpress-4-0-beta-1/">Beta 1 announcement post</a> for more details on those features. We hope to ship WordPress 4.0 <em>next week</em>, but we need your help to get there. If you haven’t tested 4.0 yet, there’s no time like the present. (Please, not on a production site, unless you’re adventurous.)</p>
<p><strong>Think you’ve found a bug? </strong>Please post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>. If any known issues come up, you’ll be able to <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">find them here</a>.</p>
<p>To test WordPress 4.0 RC1, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-RC1.zip">download the release candidate here</a> (zip). If you’d like to learn more about what’s new in WordPress 4.0, visit the awesome About screen in your dashboard (<strong><img src="http://i0.wp.com/core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/3.6/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/wordpress.png?w=692" alt="" width="16" height="16"> → About</strong> in the toolbar).</p>
<p><strong>Developers,</strong> please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 4.0 and update your plugin’s <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 4.0 before next week. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post any issues to the support forums so we can figure those out before the final release. You also may want to <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/08/21/introducing-plugin-icons-in-the-plugin-installer/">give your plugin an icon</a>, which we launched last week and will appear in the dashboard along with banners.</p>
<p><em>It is almost time</em><br><em> For the 4.0 release</em><br><em> And its awesomeness</em></p></div>
