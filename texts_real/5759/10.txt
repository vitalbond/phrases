<p>WordPress.org is officially joining the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/">protest against Senate Bill 968: the Protect IP Act</a> that is coming before the U.S. Senate next week. As I wrote in <a title="Help Stop SOPA/PIPA" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/help-stop-sopa-pipa/">my post a week ago</a>, if this bill is passed it will jeopardize internet freedom and shift the power of the independent web into the hands of corporations. We must stop it.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2012 many sites around the web &#8212; from small personal blogs to internet institutions like <a href="http://Mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Action">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html">reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/benhuh/status/157538541155516416">I Can Has Cheezburger?</a> &#8211; will be going dark in protest and to drive their visitors to sites like <a href="http://americancensorship.org">americancensorship.org</a> to take action and help fight the passage of the Protect IP Act. So will WordPress.org.</p>
<p>If you want to join the protest by blacking out your WordPress site or applying a ribbon, there is now a variety of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/sopa">blackout plugins in the WordPress.org plugins directory</a>. While joining the protest in this manner is laudable, please don&#8217;t forget to also make those phone calls to U.S. Senators &#8212; they&#8217;re the ones with the voting power.</p>
