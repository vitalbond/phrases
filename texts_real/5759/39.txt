<div><p>After <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/counter/">nearly 7 million downloads</a> of WordPress 3.6, we are pleased to announce the availability of version 3.6.1. This maintenance release <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.6.1">fixes 13 bugs</a> in version 3.6, which was a very smooth release.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress 3.6.1 is also a security release for all previous WordPress versions</strong> and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately. It addresses three issues fixed by the WordPress security team:</p>
<ul><li>Block unsafe PHP unserialization that could occur in limited situations and setups, which can lead to remote code execution. Reported by <a href="http://vagosec.org/" rel="nofollow">Tom Van Goethem</a>.</li>
<li>Prevent a user with an Author role, using a specially crafted request, from being able to create a post &ldquo;written by&rdquo; another user. Reported by <a href="http://anakornk.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Anakorn Kyavatanakij</a>.</li>
<li>Fix insufficient input validation that could result in redirecting or leading a user to another website. Reported by Dave Cummo, a Northrup Grumman subcontractor for the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" rel="nofollow">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, we&rsquo;ve adjusted security restrictions around file uploads to mitigate the potential for cross-site scripting.</p>
<p>We appreciated <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security">responsible disclosure</a> of these issues directly to our security team. For more information on the changes, see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6.1">release notes</a> or consult <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.6?stop_rev=24972&amp;rev=25345">the list of changes</a>.</p>
