<div><p>The first release candidate for WordPress 3.6 is now available.</p>
<p>We hope to ship WordPress 3.6 in a couple weeks. But to do that, we really need your help! If you haven&rsquo;t tested 3.6 yet, there&rsquo;s no time like the present. (But please: not on a live production site, unless you&rsquo;re feeling especially adventurous.)</p>
<p><strong>Think you&rsquo;ve found a bug?</strong> Please post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>. If any known issues come up, you&rsquo;ll be able to <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/6">find them here</a>. <strong>Developers,</strong> please test your plugins and themes, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can sort it out before the final release.</p>
<p>To test WordPress 3.6, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you&rsquo;ll want &ldquo;bleeding edge nightlies&rdquo;). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.6-RC1.zip">download the release candidate here (zip)</a>.</p>
<p>As you may have heard, we backed the Post Format UI feature out of the release. On the other hand, our slick new revisions browser had some extra time to develop. You should see it with 200+ revisions loaded &mdash; scrubbing back and forth at lightning speed is a thing of beauty.</p>
<p><em>Delayed, but still loved</em><br><em>The release will be out soon</em><br><em>Test it, por favor</em></p></div>
