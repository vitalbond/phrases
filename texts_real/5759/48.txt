<div><p>We&rsquo;re entering the quiet but busy part of a release, whittling down issues to bring you all of the new features you&rsquo;re excited about with the stability you expect from WordPress. There are just a few days from the &ldquo;code freeze&rdquo; for our 3.8 release, <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2013/11/wordpress-3-8-beta-1/">which includes a number of exciting enhancements</a>, so the focus is on identifying any major issues and resolving them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered about how to contribute to WordPress, here&rsquo;s a time you can: download this release candidate and use it in as many ways as you can imagine. Try to break it, and if you do, let us know how you did it so we can make sure it never happens again. If you work for a web host, this is the release you should test as much as possible and start getting your automatic upgrade systems and 1-click installers ready.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.8-RC1.zip">Download WordPress 3.8 RC1</a>&nbsp;(zip) or use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you&rsquo;ll want &ldquo;bleeding edge nightlies&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If you think you&rsquo;ve found a bug, you can post to the&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a>&nbsp;in the support forums. Or, if you&rsquo;re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report,&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5">a list of known bugs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.8">everything we&rsquo;ve fixed</a>&nbsp;so far.</p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re so close to the</em><br><em>finish line, jump in and help</em><br><em>good karma is yours.</em></p></div>
