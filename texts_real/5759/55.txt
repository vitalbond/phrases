<div><p>WordPress 3.8.2 is now available. This is an important security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This releases fixes a weakness that could let an attacker force their way into your site by forging authentication cookies. This was discovered and fixed by <a href="http://joncave.co.uk/">Jon Cave</a> of the WordPress security team.</p>
<p>It also contains a fix to prevent a user with the Contributor role from improperly publishing posts. Reported by <a href="http://edik.ch/">edik</a>.</p>
<p>This release also fixes nine bugs and contains three other security hardening changes:</p>
<ul><li>Pass along additional information when processing pingbacks to help hosts identify potentially abusive requests.</li>
<li>Fix a low-impact SQL injection by trusted users. Reported by <a href="http://www.dxw.com/">Tom Adams</a> of dxw.</li>
<li>Prevent possible cross-domain scripting through Plupload, the third-party library WordPress uses for uploading files. Reported by <a href="http://szgru.website.pl/">Szymon Gruszecki</a>.</li>
</ul><p>We appreciated <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security">responsible disclosure</a> of these security issues directly to our security team.
