<div><p>WordPress 3.9.2 is now available as a security release for all previous versions. We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release fixes a possible denial of service issue in PHP’s XML processing, reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/nirgoldshlager">Nir Goldshlager</a> of the Salesforce.com Product Security Team. It  was fixed by Michael Adams and Andrew Nacin of the WordPress security team and David Rothstein of the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-004">Drupal security team</a>. This is the first time our two projects have coordinated joint security releases.</p>
<p>WordPress 3.9.2 also contains other security changes:</p>
<ul><li>Fixes a possible but unlikely code execution when processing widgets (WordPress is not affected by default), discovered by <a href="http://www.buayacorp.com/">Alex Concha</a> of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Prevents information disclosure via XML entity attacks in the external GetID3 library, reported by <a href="http://onsec.ru/en/">Ivan Novikov</a> of ONSec.</li>
<li>Adds protections against brute attacks against CSRF tokens, reported by <a href="http://systemoverlord.com/">David Tomaschik</a> of the Google Security Team.</li>
<li>Contains some additional security hardening, like preventing cross-site scripting that could be triggered only by administrators.</li>
</ul><p>We appreciated responsible disclosure of these issues directly to our security team.
