<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 3.4 is now available. Since RC1, we&#8217;ve made a <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=21018&amp;stop_rev=20949&amp;limit=500">few dozen final changes</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal is to release WordPress 3.4 early next week, so plugin and theme authors, this is likely <strong>your last chance to test your plugins and themes to find any compatibility issues before the final release</strong>. We&#8217;ve published some resources on the <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/wordpress-3-4-field-guide-for-developers/">development blog</a> to help you prepare.</p>
<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, you can post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. Or, if you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/">file one on WordPress Trac</a>. Known issues that crop up will be listed <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/6">here</a>, but we&#8217;re hoping for a quiet few days so we can get some great features into your hands next week!</p>
<p>To test WordPress 3.4, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.4-RC2.zip">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).
