The Plone community is happy to be part of the CMS Garden again in 2014. Plone was joined the CMS Garden that was started by a joined venture of Dupal, TYPO3 and Joomla community people from Germany that came up as an idea to support Open Source at CeBIT to compensate the decreasing Open Source sponsoring from CeBIT itself.&lt;img src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plonenews/~4/9pdm6S9RDPs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
