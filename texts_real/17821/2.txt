Come to the Plone Conference 2012 and have two wonderful experiences at the same time. Meet old friends and catch up on new techniques in a city that is definitely worth the trip. Arnhem is not only the capital of Gelderland, it is also known for its arts and design education. Last, but not least, we have the famous 'bridge too far', which is a must see.
