<p>Jimmy Fallon is one of my most favorite comedians today. His spunky demeanor, and hilarious script-writing are just elements of what makes him so successful. But his knack for understanding what his fans love to share, makes Jimmy Fallon our vote for King of Content.<br><span id="more-8937"></span><br>
Back in February, Jimmy kicked off his new gig at <em>The Tonight Show</em> with an explosive show that featured U2 headlining. The show’s new host and incredibly popular headlining rock band got the web buzzing to new heights.</p>

<p>Jimmy Fallon is no stranger to the web, so to see a <strong>11,000% increase in social mentions</strong> of a popular celebrity after his first <em>Tonight Show</em> aired on February 17 is pretty neat. He nearly matched that spike when <a href="http://www.okayplayer.com/news/jimmy-fallon-justin-timberlake-history-of-rap-5-video.html" target="_blank">he invited Justin Timberlake</a> to his show five days later.</p>
<p>Jimmy’s social mentions (meaning shares and clicks on content about “Jimmy Fallon”) leveled off after a bit, but he generated good spikes after a few key airings:</p>

<p>Most of his fans shared content almost as equally between desktop (51%) and mobile (49%), though twice as many mobile devices used were iOS than Android.
