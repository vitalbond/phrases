<p>Just how valuable are followers to your content strategy? We did some research to look at different kinds of engagement behaviors—such as <a href="http://www.addthis.com/blog/2014/08/11/addthis-study-shows-mac-users-scroll-more-than-pc-users/" title="AddThis Study Shows Mac Users Scroll More than PC Users">scrolling</a>, clicking, and sharing—and how they correlate to increasing followers and conversions. We also looked for a connection between where a visitor came from (for instance, a search or social “click” referral) or what device they used. Followers proved to be of tremendous value for websites. <span id="more-9508"></span></p>
<p><strong>Followers engage with content at a substantially higher rate than typical web users.</strong></p>
<ul><li>In desktop browsers, <strong>followers scrolled 11 times and shared 30 times more often</strong> than the average web visitor</li>
<li>If a follower came from a shared link—a “social referral”—that number jumped to <strong>100 times more frequently on desktop and 28 times more on mobile browsers</strong></li>
<li>While sharers did not significantly convert at a higher rate, followers in desktop browsers <strong>converted 2.4 times more often</strong> than the web average; in mobile browsers, this number increased to 3.6 times more frequent</li>
</ul><p>The bottom line? While sharing behavior correlates well with clicks and other behaviors that get you more traffic, <strong>followers are far more likely to engage deeply and convert.</strong> This is the value of a follower, and just one of the reasons why we offer a <a href="http://addthis.com/gallery" title="AddThis Tools">suite of tools</a> for both basic and Pro users, each serving its role to increase traffic and engagement for your site.
