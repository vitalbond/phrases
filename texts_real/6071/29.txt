<p>Want to show off your share counts and encourage more sharing on your website? Now you can do both with the <a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/jumbo-share" target="_blank">new Jumbo Share Counter</a> in AddThis Pro.<span id="more-9036"></span></p>
<p>Trends in website design (and what publishers want) seems to be going big lately! Big buttons, big photos, and big bad share counters. </p>
<p>We specifically had people asking for Mashable-style share counters, so they must be doing something right. We took some cues from their buttons and created sharing buttons that are big, responsive, and customizable.</p>
<p>You can choose which buttons display, and change the color of the share counter to match your website. You can use an accent color to make them really stick out.</p>
<p>Today we also released a <a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/whats-next-mobile" target="_blank">new mobile version of the What’s Next</a> content recommendation tool. Now you can increase recirculation with mobile visitors by showing them recommended content as they scroll down the page in a layout that’s mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>We’re always looking at what features to add next, so <a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/jumbo-share" target="_blank">check out the new tools</a> in your Tool Gallery, and vote for what we should build next!</p></div>
