<p>Content engagement can mean a lot of different things. Sharing to Facebook, for example, is just one way to engage with content and a key metric for many marketers today.

<p>To effectively reach today’s multi-device, always connected consumer, advertisers and publishers need a deeper understanding of just how and when to promote content. So for our second <a href="http://cache.addthiscdn.com/site/report/Addthis_Q2_engagement_report_final_080614.pdf" target="_blank">Quarterly Content Engagement Report</a> we took a look at scrolling behavior. Our goal was to identify the scrolling mega-trends that could help advertisers and publishers understand what factors influence a reader to scroll.</p>

<p>The results were pretty interesting. What we found was that there are many things that influence scrolling behavior including device, referring URL, and even time of day.</p>
