<div><p>It’s a big day here at AddThis! Not only do all of our users get access to a new dashboard that makes it easier than ever to manage your website tools, we have new widgets and features designed to help you grow your traffic. Let’s take a look at what they are!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addthis.com/dashboard?utm_source=Freemium%20Product%20Update&#38;utm_medium=Blog%20Post&#38;utm_content=Sign%20Into%20Dashboard&#38;utm_campaign=Freemium%20Launch" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.addthiscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/addthis-basic-user-announcement-dashboard.png" alt="addthis-basic-user-announcement-dashboard" width="100%" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8823"></a></p>

<h3>Take Control with the New Dashboard</h3>
<p>Previously an exclusive Pro feature, the dashboard is now available to our free users as well! You can see your new dashboard and easily activate your widgets by just signing into your account. </p>
<p>What’s so awesome about the dashboard? You can turn tools on and off, edit your tool settings, and manage your account—without having to change your code. </p>

<p>Once you activate new tools, you’ll also see how many shares, follows and clicks they generate on your site. These streamlined analytics will help you see how well your AddThis tools are working, and try out new tools to increase engagement with your visitors. (You can still access the classic analytics view through the user dropdown in the dashboard for the time being.)</p>

<h3>Personalized Content Recommendations</h3>
<p>Now we’re offering seven different content recommendation widgets that work with pretty much any website! These widgets show recommended content to your visitors based popularity as well as our social data. They’re designed to help increase recirculation (i.e. more clicks) on your site by showing them most relevant articles.</p>
<p>Adding content recommendations to your site is a great way of using social data from your AddThis tools to show more relevant content to visitors. Join the over 100,000 websites already using our content recommendations powered by social data from 14 million domains using AddThis!</p>
<h3>Custom Widgets for Pro Subscribers</h3>
<p>Pro subscribers are also going to see new things in their tool gallery. Starting today, you’ll have access to three new exclusive tools. Check out the custom share and follow buttons, where you can now customize and activate the tools to look the way you want them to.</p>

<p>Pros will also see the brand New Recommended Content Toaster that shows your visitors, not one, but two content recommendations as they scroll down the page. This comes on top of the personalized content recommendations in Pro that result in a 50% increase in recommended content clicks for subscribers.</p>
