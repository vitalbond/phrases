<p>Recently we also introduced our Welcome Bar conversion tool. Since it’s launch, activation of the tool has skyrocketed, becoming our most installed tool to date! You told us you wanted more tools to help drive more conversions on your site, so with that, we’re giving you the Conversion Lightbox.</p>
<p>The AddThis Conversion Lightbox tool can be customized to suit your site’s design and messaging. It’s responsive on all mobile devices, creating a seamless user experience for your visitors no matter where they see your site. The Lightbox can appear either after a visitor indicates they’re leaving your page or when they scroll down a page. </p>

<p>Our integration with MailChimp also helps make it easy for both site owners and users. Once you set it up on your site, your visitor simply enters their email information, clicks “Submit,” and they’ll receive a confirmation message sent by MailChimp. Your subscriber’s information will then be waiting in your MailChimp account.</p>
