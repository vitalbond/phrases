<p>Think it’s too early to worry about Cyber Monday and holiday search traffic? Think again. <span id="more-9217"></span></p>
<p>In 2013, Cyber Monday sales increased by nearly 16%, and mobile spending more than doubled seeing a 55% increase. <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2013/12/03/cyber-monday-shatters-online-spending-record" target="_blank">Online shoppers spent $2.29 billion dollars</a> surpassing the record set the previous year by $36 million dollars. That equates to roughly 900 million visits to over 2,000 retail sites in one day. That’s a LOT of traffic that ended up marking the largest day for online spending in U.S. History!</p>
<p>With all this searching and shopping online, it can be easy to get lost in the mix during the holiday shopping season. How can you make sure that your visitors <strong>stay</strong> on your site and <strong>take the action</strong> you intend for them to take?</p>
<p>There are a few simple actions you can take in order to stand out and keep visitors engaged.</p>
<h3>1. Create a Personalized Experience with Recommended Content</h3>
<p><a title="Content Recommendations: How They Work" href="http://www.addthis.com/blog/2014/06/05/content-recommendations-how-they-work/" target="_blank">Recommended and personalized content tools</a> help keep users engaged (like clicking) on your site. It can get easy to be overwhelmed online when you’re searching, so keep that in mind when you’re thinking about what and how to tailor your visitors’ experience. Make it appealing to stay on your site by serving up suggested content before they’re inclined to leave.</p>
<h3>2. Use Tools that Drive Conversions</h3>
<p>Using tools that help convert your users, like our <a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/welcome-bar" target="_blank">Welcome Bar</a>, and our our soon-to-be-released conversion overlay tool (check our blog tomorrow for an update!) help direct your users where you want them to go or what action you want them to take.</p>
<p>And don’t forget mobile users! Mobile shopping continues to grow, specifically during the holiday season. Mobile shoppers contributed to 18.3% of total e-commerce sales in 2013—a total of $419 million in sales across smartphones and tablets. Making it easy for mobile users to take an action is vital.</p>
<h3>3. Use Tools to Get Your Content Shared</h3>
<p>Last year, social sharing played a major role in how and why retail stores saw such a huge increase. Out of the mainstream social sites, Facebook and Pinterest drove the most traffic. Of that traffic, shoppers referred from Facebook spent 6% ($97.81) more per order than shoppers referred to from Pinterest ($92.40). So if you’re not using the share tools on your site already, you are missing out on a huge opportunity to deliver content from your site across social platforms—a reliable source of information for most savvy shoppers.</p>
<p>Most e-commerce sites have been prepping for months to ensure that their content is compelling, their products are intriguing, their mobile site is responsive, and their social sharing tools are primed and ready to go. The holiday season is literally just around the corner and there’s no time like the present to make sure you grab a piece of the holiday (traffic) pie.</p>
