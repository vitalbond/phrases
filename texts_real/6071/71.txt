<p>Following the announcement of our newest tool in the suite, the <a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/conversion-lightbox" target="_blank">Conversion Lightbox</a>, you might be asking yourself, why do you need a conversion tool?<span id="more-9485"></span></p>
<p>It’s actually quite simple.</p>
<p>The web is a large place. It’s hard to drive visitors to your site and once they’re there you have to peak their interest. You spend a lot of time and effort creating content that is engaging and beneficial to the visitor. But once they’ve read the article, perused the products and spent time on your site are you giving them a solid action to take? One that <strong>you</strong> drive to help achieve your individual business goals?</p>
<p>If you answered no, then you’re missing out on a huge opportunity.</p>
<p>Conversion tools do not have to be jarring, annoying or even the same. The simplicity of conversion tools is <strong>timing</strong>. Giving your visitor an appropriate action to take while they are actively engaged on your site is more effective than asking them to take that same action in an email or on a social site.</p>
<p>For example: say your visitor is on your blog right now. He/she has read the entire article and clicks to leave your page. This is an opportunity to serve up a “Like this article? Subscribe to our blog to get notified when new posts are available!” message by using a beautiful and simple tool they’ll want to engage with.</p>
<p><strong>This</strong> is why using conversion tools, like our <a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/welcome-bar" target="_blank">Welcome Bar</a> or <a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/conversion-lightbox" target="_blank">Conversion Lightbox</a>, on your website is important. You’re giving your visitors a chance to engage with your further. So if simple tools can help you do that, what’s holding you back?</p></div>
