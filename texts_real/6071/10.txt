<p>Today marks another milestone in the evolution of AddThis. When you sign in today, many of you will notice a brand new dashboard that has something for everyone. Previously we had two different dashboards: one for free users and one for our Pro customers. <span id="more-8819"></span> Starting today, we have one unified dashboard experience for everyone, and we’ve added even more features for Pro users. We made these changes based on feedback from our passionate and engaged community of website owners, including Pro users who made it clear they wanted to see even more widget options.</p>
<p>One of the first things you’ll notice is the AddThis Tool Gallery which lets you quickly see all your widget options and activate them without changing your code. Even long time AddThis users can upgrade to our latest widgets in minutes.</p>
<p>There are now a total of <strong>19 widgets</strong> to choose from including seven different options for recommended content, providing you with maximum flexibility in style, functionality and placement. We’ve got even more widgets in the works—including mobile options—so keep checking your Tool Gallery for additional updates.</p>
<p>When you upgrade to Pro, you’ll see more engagement and, ultimately, more traffic. The AddThis sharing sidebar, for example, can double your performance over inline sharing buttons and our Pro recommendation widgets typically see a 50% higher click-through-rate compared the Basic version.</p>
<p>AddThis recommended content and other widgets have an advantage because they’re personalized for each of your visitors based on AddThis data, which reaches over 98% of the Internet. We’re the first company to make such powerful, personalized website tools available at a price that’s accessible to virtually any website owner.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a longstanding customer or someone who is brand new to AddThis, there’s never been a better time to be working with us. <a href="http://www.addthis.com/dashboard?utm_source=CEO%20Announcement&#38;utm_medium=Blog%20Post&#38;utm_content=Sign%20Into%20Dashboard&#38;utm_campaign=Freemium%20Launch" target="_blank">Sign in</a>, and tell us what you think by posting your comments below.</p></div>
