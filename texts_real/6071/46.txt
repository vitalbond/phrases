<p>We’re excited to announce a plethora of new services being added to the AddThis menu including WhatsApp—the extremely popular mobile messaging app.<span id="more-9227"></span></p>

<li>Behance—a great place to showcase your creative work and now an easier way for people to find your portfolio</li>
<li>Disqus—a community within a community, this service helps you connect and engage with other active readers and commenters</li>
</ul><h3>Share Tools:</h3>
<ul><li>WhatsApp—easily share content on this increasingly popular cross-platform mobile messaging application</li>

</ul><p>We’re really excited with the launch of the WhatsApp sharing tool supported on iOS devices, and the benefits it lends to our users, especially our international friends. With over 500 million active users (that’s a lot), adding this share option will certainly help increase both traffic to your site and content engagement.</p>
