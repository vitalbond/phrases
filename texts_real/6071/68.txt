With AddThis being on over 13M website domains and being seen by 1.7B people every month across the globe, we get a unique picture of what the Web is buzzing about. <span id="more-9464"></span></p>
<p>We did a quick pull of the data and made a chart of skyrocketing brand awareness for the Apple Watch, on the day of the announcement.</p>

<p>We know a new product announcement from Apple is always going to be big news, especially in the tech scene, and until it actually comes out in stores, we think it will be a topic of conversation for months to come.</p>
