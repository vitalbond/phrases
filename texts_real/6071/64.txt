<div><p>Earlier this week, news broke that an <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/website-add-on-targets-japanese-users-leads-to-exploit-kit/" target="_blank">exploit kit known as FlashPack</a> had been used on third party buttons by publishers in Japan who added a particular JavaScript to their site. <strong>FlashPack is completely unrelated to AddThis tools,</strong> and therefore, AddThis users do not need to worry about this malicious script affecting any of our tools on your site. In everything we build, security is our top concern. News of this exploit kit is a good reminder to always be sure the add-on provider you use is a party you trust, and to keep your site security tight.</p></div>
