<p>Big, beautiful photos have become a huge trend across the Web recently. If your website uses this type of visual format in your content, you’ll want a way to showcase those images in your widgets.<span id="more-9248"></span></p>
<p>Most recommended content units focus on showing multiple articles, scaling your images into tiny thumbnails. That’s why we created the <strong><a href="https://www.addthis.com/dashboard#gallery/tools/recommended-jumbo" target="_blank">Jumbo Recommended Content Footer</a></strong> for Pro users. </p>
<p>The Jumbo Content Footer adds one beautiful full-width image to the bottom of your page with the title overlayed. </p>
<p>To get the images to look spectacular, make sure you have <a href="http://www.addthis.com/blog/2014/07/03/optimize-your-content-recommendations-with-open-graph-tags-2/#.U-y5mIBdVig" target="_blank">open graph tags</a> set in place. The images don’t even have to be that large to look amazing. We’ve tested the footer with images as small as 400px wide and they still look great!</p>
<p>This is just another way to use our Recommended Content tools to show the right content at the right time to each of your visitors. These <a href="http://www.addthis.com/blog/2014/03/25/content-recommendation-widgets-how-do-they-work/#.U-y5xoBdVig" target="_blank">recommendations are based</a> on both popularity and the context of the article that the person is viewing. Pro members also get an added layer of behavioral and interest data that boosts the performance of these tools by 50%. That’s in addition to exclusive access to all of our Pro sharing, following, and recommended content tools in the Tool Gallery.</p>
