<p>We had a great turn-out at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nova-ux/events/175315442/" target="_blank">last night&rsquo;s NoVA UX meetup</a>, where <a href="https://twitter.com/dpan" target="_blank">David Panarelli</a> gave a fun and informative talk about transitioning into a career in user experience.&nbsp;<span id="more-8725"></span> For the uninitiated, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience" target="_blank">user experience (or &ldquo;UX&rdquo;)</a> is an umbrella for many different disciplines, such as user research, interface design, visual design and even content strategy.</p>

<p>David began by describing what we as user experience designers do, and the process and tools behind that work. This led to a spirited side discussion about <a title="Agile development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">agile development</a> and <a title="Lean UX" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/" target="_blank">lean UX</a>. He then described the pros, cons, and typical timeframes of three paths: graduate school, night school, and the &ldquo;school of hard knocks.&rdquo; That last path includes those of us who taught ourselves, created our own professional networks, and learned on the job.</p>
