<p>Can UX designers be product strategists? Absolutely, says Kevin Vigneault from <a title="Viget Labs" href="http://viget.com/" target="_blank">Viget</a> Labs, who gave a talk about product strategy, and how UX designers can provide leadership in this area, at last night’s NoVA UX meetup. <span id="more-9043"></span></p>
<p>Kevin began by outlining several advantages UX designers enjoy that are relevant to product strategy: a customer-centric perspective, research and testing skills, and familiarity with both design and development process.</p>
<p>He then explored the ideas of product, product strategy, and how a team makes key decisions about product such as what to build and how much to charge. He also shared a model describing how teams can move through stages of product strategy sophistication: not releasing anything, releasing everything, and hoping something good happens, then finally releasing and iterating groups of features that fit together either because of customer needs or other strategic reasons.</p>
