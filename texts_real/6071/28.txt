<p>The Welcome Bar is a great way to help increase conversions on your website. Some of our community members have told us they use the Welcome Bar to promote a link with a call to action, get email subscribers, or to show a custom sharing message to people visiting from a particular social network.</p>
<p>We want to hear from you. What kinds of goals do you want to drive with the Welcome Bar? What do you think of the Welcome Bar’s layout? Is it the right one for your website? </p>
<p>And are there other overlays or in-page tools we could build that would help you promote and measure your conversion goals?</p>
