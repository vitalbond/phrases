<p>It’s the Yankee Captain’s last series of games this week, and fans have poured onto the web to express their feelings, good and bad, about Derek Jeter’s farewell. Brands have also jumped on the sentimental bandwagon (which is called trendacking) by releasing exposé interviews and videos in homage of Jeter’s career—and you should, too. Jeter’s ends his career as shortstop in Boston this Sunday, September 28th. You’ve got three days. <span id="more-9584"></span></p>

<p>The second spike, on September 7th, was when Yankee Stadium declared it “Derek Jeter Day” and <a href="http://7online.com/sports/derek-jeter-honored-in-ceremony-at-yankee-stadium/298030/" target="_blank">honored the captain in the pregame ceremony</a>. Other popularly shared stories include <a href="http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s3567501.shtml" target="_blank">the little girl who threw a foul ball</a> back into the field, tributes he received from teams, including the Rays’ <a href="http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/Clip/10591663/derek-jeters-kayak-10pm" target="_blank">kayak</a>, and <a href="http://www.wwmt.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/Derek-Jeter-being-honored-41425.shtml?app_data=%7B%22pi%22%3A%22541adc951dbff1c44c00000f%22%2C%22pt%22%3A%22wall%22%7D#.VCQ6fWRdVig" target="_blank">his hometown of Kalamazoo</a>. </p>
