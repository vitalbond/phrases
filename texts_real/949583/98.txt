<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">Web Performance Working Group</a> has published a Group Note of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-resource-priorities-20141023/">Resource Priorities</a>. This specification defines a means for site developers to programmatically give the User Agent hints on the download priority of a resource, to allow User Agents to more efficiently manage the order in which resources are downloaded. This specification is no longer maintained and has been abandoned; refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/">resource hints</a> instead.
