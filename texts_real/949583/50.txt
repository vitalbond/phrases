<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">Protocols and Formats Working Group (PFWG)</a> today published an updated Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/media-accessibility-reqs-20140814/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a>, a planned W3C Working Group Note. This document describes the accessibility requirements of people with disabilities with respect to audio and video on the Web, particularly in the context of HTML5. It explains alternative content technologies that people use to get audio and video content, and how these fit in the larger picture of accessibility, both technically within a web user agent and from a production process point of view.
