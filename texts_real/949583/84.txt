In a <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/1994/lcs-1019">1994 press release about the launch of W3C</a>, Director <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> explained, “The decision to form the consortium came at the urging of many firms investing increasing resources into the Web, whether in creation of software products, selling information, or for sharing information within their own companies, with business partners and the public at large.” Twenty years on, the W3C community is actively building an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build sophisticated interactive experiences that are available on any device. Pursuing a vision of one Web available to all, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">400 Members</a>, thousands of individuals in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities">Working and Interest Groups</a>, nearly 4500 people in <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/">Community and Business Groups</a>, and many more subscribed to public mailing lists power today’s W3C community. W3C thanks all of you for 20 years of creating, implementing, and supporting <a href="http://open-stand.org/">open standards</a> for the Web.</p>
