<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a> has published a Last Call Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html5-20140617/">HTML5</a>. This specification defines the 5th major revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features are introduced to help Web application authors, new elements are introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention has been given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability. Comments are welcome through <strong>15 July 2014</strong>.</p>
<p>The group also published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-html51-20140617/">HTML 5.1</a>. HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents. The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as Web Applications. This standard attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML language to address issues raised in the past few years.</p>
