It also predefines a set of common counter styles, including the ones present in CSS2 and CSS2.1. Comments are welcome through <strong>23 September</strong>. CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/">Style Activity</a>.</p></div>
