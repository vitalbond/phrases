<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/IndieUI/">IndieUI Working Group</a> today published an updated Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-indie-ui-events-20140529/">IndieUI: Events 1.0</a> &ndash; Events for User Interface Independence. This draft includes  new events and a refined technical model. IndieUI defines a way for different user interactions to be translated into simple events and communicated to Web applications. (For example, if a user wants to scroll down a page, they might use their finger on a touch screen, or click a scroll bar with a mouse, or use a scroll wheel, or say &lsquo;scroll down&rsquo; with a voice command. With IndieUI, these are all sent to the Web app as simply: scroll down.) IndieUI will make it easier for Web applications to work in a wide range of contexts &mdash; different devices (such as mobile phones and tablets), different assistive technologies (AT), different user needs. With IndieUI, Web application developers will have a uniform way to design applications that work for multiple devices and contexts. Comments on this Draft are encouraged by 27 June 2014.
