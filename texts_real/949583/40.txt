<div><p>W3C and its European host, ERCIM, announce the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/workshop/samos/report">report</a> from the first workshop in the Share-PSI 2.0 series. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/">Share-PSI 2.0</a> is the European network for the exchange of experience and ideas around implementing open data policies in the public sector. It brings together government departments, standards bodies, academic institutions, commercial organisations, trade associations and interest groups to identify what does and doesn’t work, what is and isn’t practical, what can and can’t be expected of different stakeholders.</p>
<p>In the first workshop, held as part of the 5th Annual <a href="http://samos-summit.org/">Samos Summit on ICT-enabled Governance</a>, the focus was <strong>Uses of Open Data Within Government for Innovation and Efficiency</strong>. The report shows the many different strategies being adopted to foster a culture of data sharing across the public sector leading to significant efficiencies in operation, more effective delivery of the public task, reduced corruption and greater trust in important institutions like the police. From Helsinki to Athens via Dublin and Zagreb, from Oslo to Madrid via Tirana, Tenerife and Trentino – the public sector is making smarter use of the Web.</p>
<p>The Samos workshop also sets us up nicely for the next workshop in the series. Taking place in Lisbon in the first week in December, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/workshop/lisbon/">Encouraging open data usage by commercial developers</a> will be highly interactive with many facilitated discussions and very few presentations.</p>
<p>W3C membership is not required to participate. The event is open to all, but all participants are required to submit a position paper or statement of interest by <strong>5 October 2014</strong>. Share-PSI 2.0 is coordinated by W3C/ERCIM as part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/data/">Data Activity</a> and is closely aligned with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a>.</p></div>
