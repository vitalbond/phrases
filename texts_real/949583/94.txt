<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/">Web Real-Time Communications Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-webrtc-stats-20141021/">Identifiers for WebRTCâ€™s Statistics API</a>. Audio, video, or data packets transmitted over a peer-connection can be lost, and experience varying amounts of network delay. A web application implementing WebRTC expects to monitor the performance of the underlying network and media pipeline. This document defines the APIs and statistic identifiers used by the web application to extract metrics from the user agent.
