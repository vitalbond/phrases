<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF">Protocols and Formats Working Group</a> today published a First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-core-aam-1.1-20140612/">Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1</a> (Core-AAM), which supports the updated Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-wai-aria-1.1-20140612/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1</a>. WAI-ARIA provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA</a> is designed to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content, particularly web applications. Core-AAM describes how user agents should expose semantics of content languages to accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> across multiple content technologies (including much of WAI-ARIA). Core-AAM serves as the basis for other specifications to extend the mappings to specific technologies. Learn more from the   <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2014AprJun/0190.html" title="Core-AAM and ARIA announcement June 2014">call for review e-mail</a> and read about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>.</p></div>
