<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-css-regions-1-20141009/">CSS Regions Module Level 1</a>. The CSS Regions module allows content from one or more elements to flow through one or more boxes called CSS Regions, fragmented as defined in CSS3-BREAK. This module also defines CSSOM to expose both the inputs and outputs of this fragmentation. CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/">Style Activity</a>.</p></div>
