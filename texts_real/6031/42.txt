<div><p>W3C enacted today the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/">1 August 2014 W3C Process Document</a>. This revision updates the chapter that defines the Recommendation Track, the steps and requirements followed by W3C Working Groups to standardize Web technology. The W3C technical report development process is designed to support multiple specification development methodologies: maximize consensus about the content of stable technical reports; ensure high technical and editorial quality; promote consistency among specifications; facilitate royalty-free, interoperable implementations of Web Standards; and earn endorsement by W3C and the broader community. The primary change to the Recommendation Track is to merge “Last Call” and “Candidate Recommendation.” A <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/ProcessTransition2014">Process Transition FAQ</a> lists other changes to the Recommendation Track, explains the two-year transition plan for adoption by groups, describes the relation to the W3C Patent Policy, and more.</p>
<p>This document was developed between the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/ab/">W3C Advisory Board</a> and the public <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/w3process">Revising W3C Process Community Group</a>.</p></div>
