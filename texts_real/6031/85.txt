This specification defines the syntax and semantics of XSLT 3.0, a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. A transformation in the XSLT language is expressed in the form of a stylesheet. A stylesheet is made up of one or more well-formed XML documents conforming to the Namespaces in XML Recommendation. Comments are welcome through <strong>26 November</strong>. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">Extensible Markup Language (XML) Activity</a>.</p></div>
