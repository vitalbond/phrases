<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a> has published a Candidate Recommendation of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-html-longdesc-20140812/">HTML5 Image Description Extension</a>, which defines the “longdesc” attribute that enables web authors to provide longer textual descriptions for complex images. This specification is part of W3C’s work to ensure that the Open Web Platform is accessible to people with disabilities. This publication addresses comments received during Last Call, and invites implementations. It is developed by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/html-accessibility-tf.html">HTML Accessibility Task Force</a> in coordination with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">WAI</a> Protocols and Formats Working Group (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">PFWG</a>). Please see details in the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2014JulSep/0027.html">Call for Implementations: HTML5 Image Description Extension (longdesc) e-mail</a>.
