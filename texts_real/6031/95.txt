<div><p>W3C published today the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/webcrypto-next-workshop/report.html">report</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/webcrypto-next-workshop/">W3C Web Cryptography Next Steps: Authentication, Hardware Tokens and Beyond</a> workshop held on 10-11 September, 2014, in Mountain View. Participants at the workshop expressed unanimous support for including standards-based access to hardware tokens in the charter of a future W3C Working Group or re-chartering of existing groups. Multi-factor and secure authentication are some of the driving use-cases. The discussion over chartering will take place on the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-security/">Web Security</a> public mailing list. W3C considers secure key storage and access to cryptographic operations important for the future of the Web. The fully booked Workshop was hosted by Microsoft, and sponsored by Google and Tyfone.
