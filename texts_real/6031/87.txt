<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a> has published two documents today:</p>
<ul class="show_items"><li>A First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-selection-api-20141007/">Selection API</a>. This document is a preliminary draft of a specification for the Selection API and selection related functionality. It replaces a couple of old sections of the HTML specification, the selection part of the old DOM Range specification.</li>
<li>A Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-push-api-20141007/">Push API</a>. The Push API provides webapps with scripted access to server-sent messages, for simplicity referred to here as push messages, as delivered by push services. A push service allows a webapp server to send messages to a webapp, regardless of whether the webapp is currently active on the user agent. The push message will be delivered to a Service Worker, which could then store the messageâ€™s data or display a notification to the user. This specification is designed to promote compatibility with any delivery method for push messages from push services to user agents.</li>
