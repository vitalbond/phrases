<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group</a> invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-css3-background-20140909/">CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3</a>. CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. This draft contains the features of CSS level 3 relating to borders and backgrounds. It includes and extends the functionality of CSS level 2, which builds on CSS level 1. The main extensions compared to level 2 are borders consisting of images, boxes with multiple backgrounds, boxes with rounded corners and boxes with shadows. This module replaces two earlier drafts: CSS3 Backgrounds and CSS3 Border. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/">Style Activity</a>.</p></div>
