<div><p> The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/IndieUI/">IndieUI Working Group</a> today published a First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-indie-ui-context-20140626/">IndieUI: User Context 1.0 – Contextual Information for User Interface Independence</a>. It defines a set of preferences that users can choose to expose to web applications, and an API for user agents to access the preferences and listen for changes. Users can set preferences for features such as screen size, font size, and color. Users with disabilities can provide information about assistive technologies in use, indicate that the display is in an accessibility mode, and indicate what kind of subtitles and audio descriptions they need. Web applications can use this information to optimize the presentation without a requirement to target a specific device, operating system, or locale. IndieUI: User Context complements <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events/">IndieUI: Events 1.0</a> to provide web application developers a uniform way to design web applications that work in a wide range of contexts — different devices (such as mobile phones and tablets), different assistive technologies (AT), different user needs. Comments on this Draft are encouraged by <strong>1 August 2014</strong>.
