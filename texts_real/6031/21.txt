<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/">Linked Data Platform (LDP) Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-ldp-primer-20140626/">Linked Data Platform 1.0 Primer</a>. This primer provides an introduction to the Linked Data Platform (LDP), with examples illustrating the principal concepts such as the notion of an LDP resource and the LDP container and how they can be used by Web clients. Two sample scenarios show how an LDP client can interact with a LDP server in the context of a read-write Linked Data application i.e. how to use HTTP for accessing, updating, creating and deleting resources from servers that expose their resources as Linked Data.
