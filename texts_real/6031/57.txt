<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a> has published two documents today:</p>
<ul class="show_items"><li>A Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-encrypted-media-20140828/">Encrypted Media Extensions</a>. This proposal extends HTMLMediaElement providing APIs to control playback of protected content. The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation). License/key exchange is controlled by the application. This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact with such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems.</li>
<li>A Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-2dcontext2-20140828/">HTML Canvas 2D Context, Level 2</a>. This specification defines the 2D Context for the HTML canvas element. The 2D Context provides objects, methods, and properties to draw and manipulate graphics on a canvas drawing surface.</li>
