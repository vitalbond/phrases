<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-mediaqueries-4-20140605/">Media Queries Level 4</a>. Media Queries allow authors to test and query values or features of the user agent or display device, independent of the document being rendered. They are used in the CSS <code>@media</code> rule to conditionally apply styles to a document, and in various other contexts and languages, such as HTML and Javascript. Media Queries Level 4 describes the mechanism and syntax of media queries, media types, and media features. The specification extends and supersedes the features defined in Media Queries Level 3. CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/">Style Activity</a>.</p></div>
