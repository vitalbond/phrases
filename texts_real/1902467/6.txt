<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-selectors-nonelement-1-20140603/">Non-element Selectors Module Level 1</a>. This specification extends Selectors Level 4 and allows selecting other kinds of document nodes than elements. This is useful when selectors are used as a general document query language. Non-element Selectors are not intended to be used in CSS, but only as a separate query language in other host environments. CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/">Style Activity</a>.</p></div>
