<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20140925/">Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification</a>. DOM Events is designed with two main goals. The first goal is the design of an event system which allows registration of event listeners and describes event flow through a tree structure. Additionally, the specification will provide standard modules of events for user interface control and document mutation notifications, including defined contextual information for each of these event modules. The second goal of DOM Events is to provide a common subset of the current event systems used in existing browsers. This is intended to foster interoperability of existing scripts and content.
