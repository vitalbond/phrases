<div><p>The First Public Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-WAET-20140724/">Developersâ€™ Guide to Features of Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools</a> was published today by the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/">ERT WG</a>). The document describes features that web authoring tools and quality assurance tools can incorporate to support web accessibility evaluation. It is useful for tool developers to get introductory guidance on these features, and is useful for people who want to compare tools, for example, during procurement. The document is intended to promote awareness of accessibility evaluation tool features and to encourage tool developers to include relevant features  so that  tools better support Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag"><abbr>WCAG</abbr></a>) 2.0 conformance evaluation.
