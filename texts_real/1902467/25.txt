<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/">CSV on the Web Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-csvw-ucr-20140701/">CSV on the Web: Use Cases and Requirements</a>. A large percentage of the data published on the Web is tabular data, commonly published as comma separated values (CSV) files. The CSV on the Web Working Group aim to specify technologies that provide greater interoperability for data dependent applications on the Web when working with tabular datasets comprising single or multiple files using CSV, or similar, format. This document lists the use cases considered representative of how tabular data is commonly used within data dependent applications. This document also provides a set of requirements derived from these use cases that have been used to guide the specification design.
