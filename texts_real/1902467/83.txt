<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-dpub-latinreq-20140930/">Requirements for Latin Text Layout and Pagination</a>. This document describes requirements for pagination and layout of books in latin languages, based on the tradition of print book design and composition. It is hoped that these principles can inform the pagination of digital content as well, and serve as a reference for the CSS Working Group and other interested parties. This work was inspired by the Requirements for Japanese Text Layout. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/">Digital Publishing Activity</a>.</p></div>
