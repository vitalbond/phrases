<div><p>Today the W3C announced a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/privacyws/">Workshop on Privacy and User–Centric Controls</a>, to investigate strategies toward better privacy protection on the Web, especially for mobile devices.</p>
<p>The Workshop focus will be on users: user experience, user behavior and how we can offer controls that provide the necessary transparency of privacy-affecting interactions.
