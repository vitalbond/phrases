<div><p>W3C today launched a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/Social/">Social Activity</a> to develop standards to make it easier to build and integrate social applications with the Open Web Platform. Future standards —including vocabularies for social applications, activity streams, embedded experiences and in-context actions, and protocols to federate social information such as status updates— will address use cases that range from social business applications, to cross-organization federation, to greater user control over personal data. Read the complete <strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/06/social.html.en">joint press release with OpenSocial Foundation</a>.</strong></p>
<p>W3C chartered two groups today to carry out these activities:</p>
<ul class="show_items"><li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Social/WG">Social Web Working Group</a> will define the technical standards and APIs to facilitate access to social functionality as part of the Open Web Platform. These include a common JSON-based syntax for social data, a client-side API, and a Web protocol for federating social information such as status updates.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Social/IG">Social Interest Group</a> will co-ordinate messaging around social at the W3C and formulate a broad strategy to enable social business and federation. It will harvest use-cases and review specifications produced by technical working groups in the light of those use-cases.</li>
</ul><p>The Social Web Working Group’s first face-to-face meeting will take place the last week of October, as part of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/11/TPAC/">TPAC 2014</a>, W3C’s annual gathering of Working Groups.</p></div>
