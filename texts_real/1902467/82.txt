<div><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working Group</a> has published a Working Draft of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-ttml-imsc1-20140930/">TTML Text and Image Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0</a>. This document specifies two profiles of Timed Text Markup Language 1: a text-only profile and an image-only profile. These profiles are intended to be used across subtitle and caption delivery applications worldwide, thereby simplifying interoperability, consistent rendering and conversion to other subtitling and captioning formats. The text profile is a superset of TTML Simple Delivery Profile for Closed Captions (US). Learn more about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/">Video in the Web Activity</a>.</p></div>
