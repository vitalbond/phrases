This specification defines the fifth major revision of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the format used to build Web pages and applications, and the cornerstone of the Open Web Platform.</p>
<p>“<em>Today we think nothing of watching video and audio natively in the browser, and nothing of running a browser on a phone,</em>” said <strong>Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director</strong>. “<em>We expect to be able to share photos, shop, read the news, and look up information anywhere, on any device. Though they remain invisible to most users, HTML5 and the Open Web Platform are driving these growing user expectations.</em>”</p>
<p>HTML5 brings to the Web video and audio tracks without needing plugins; programmatic access to a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which is useful for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly; native support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) and math (MathML); annotations important for East Asian typography (Ruby); features to enable accessibility of rich applications; and much more.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/Testing">HTML5 test suite</a>, which  
includes over 100,000 tests and continues to grow, is strengthening browser interoperability. Learn more about the <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/">Test the Web Forward</a> community effort.</p>
<p>With today’s publication of the Recommendation, software implementers benefit from <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/40318/showCommitments">Royalty-Free licensing commitments</a> from over sixty companies under W3C’s Patent Policy. Enabling implementers to use Web technology without payment of royalties is critical to making the Web a platform for innovation.</p>
