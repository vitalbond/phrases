          The 1.0 release of the markup validator is an enhancement and
          bug fix release. Changes include:
        </p>
            <ul><li>
            Enhancement: when passing its internal transcoded document to
            external validators, validator now reflects the transcoding
            by modifying character encoding information included in the
            passed document.
          </li>
               <li>
            Enhancement: updates to validator's internal DTD library.
          </li>
               <li>
            Enhancement: XML wellformedness check now supports external
            entities instead of just suppressing error messages about them
            internally. As a side effect, this should work around a specific
            case of a certain
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9899" shape="rect">performance
              problem with XML::LibXML 1.70</a>.
          </li>
               <li>
            Bug fix: doctype override could place a malformed comment
            in the modified document.
          </li>
               <li>
            Bug fix: error messages were not properly HTML escaped when
            "show source" was selected.
          </li>
               <li>
            Dependency changes: new minimum required versions: HTML-Parser
            3.60, XML-LibXML 1.70.
          </li>
               <li>
            â€¦ and a whole slew of minor spelling, code cleanup, link and the
            like fixes here and there.
          </li>
            </ul></div>
