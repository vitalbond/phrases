          0.8.4 may sound like a very minor step from the
          <a href="http://validator.w3.org/whatsnew.html#t2008-08-08" shape="rect">version 0.8.3 released in August</a>, but this
          new release of the W3C Markup Validator brings some very important
          change: in addition to checking documents against established
          standards such as HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, the validator can now
          check documents for conformance to
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/" title="Home page of the HTML Working Group at W3C" shape="rect">HTML5</a>,
          thanks to the integration with the
          <a href="http://about.validator.nu/" shape="rect">Validator.nu</a> html5 engine.
        </p>
            <p>
          HTML5 is still work in progress and support for this next generation
          of the publishing language of the World Wide Web will remain
          experimental, but this integration should provide experimentation
          grounds for those interested in trying on authoring in this new
          version of HTML, as well as a feedback channel for the group working
          on building a stable, open standard.

          Other bug fixes and improvement in this version include:

            <ul><li>
            Bug Fix: version <a href="http://validator.w3.org/whatsnew.html#t2008-08-08" shape="rect">0.8.3</a> came with a
            programming mistake that would not affect validation, but would
            flood the validator servers' logs with warnings.
          </li>
               <li>
            Bug Fix - Document type support. A Typo in the machine-readable
            grammar published with the latest specification for XHTML 1.1
            caused spurrious validation errors when checking documents against
            XHTML 1.1.
            <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-cvs/2008Nov/0029.html" shape="rect">Fixing the typo</a>
            solves the issue. Another
            <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-cvs/2008Aug/0018.html" shape="rect">fixed typo</a>
            now makes the validation against the historical HTML i18n document
            type functional.
          </li>
               <li>
            Documentation updates and fixes: the
            <a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/install.html" shape="rect">installation documentation</a> used a
            misspelled option for the installation of the OpenSP parser. The
            correction should make installation of the validator a little
            easier. Also relevant to installing the validator, the
            <a href="http://validator.w3.org/config/validator.conf" shape="rect">sample validator configuration</a>
            now includes documentation of
            <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-cvs/2008Nov/0008.html" shape="rect">environment variables affecting connectivity</a>.
