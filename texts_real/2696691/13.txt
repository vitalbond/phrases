          The 0.8.5 release of the markup validator is a feature and bugfix
          release. Changes include:
        </p>
            <ul><li>
            UI fix: many of our users were confused by the behaviour of the
            "More options" arrow. A small UI change should make the user
            experience less confusing.
          </li>
               <li>
            New Feature: fuzzy matching used to suggest corrected markup.
            Analysis of many invalid pages shows that the most common error
            comes from invalid (typo or non standard) elements and attributes
            used. The
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/systeam/2009/02/16/validator_fuzzy_match" title="blog post on the validator's fuzzy matching" shape="rect">new
              feature</a> will help by suggesting possible (valid)
            alternatives.
          </li>
               <li>
            Bug Fix: <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6524" shape="rect">issues with SVG</a>
            were creating very large log output when validating SVG documents.
            The validator code has been amended to limit this log flood.
          </li>
               <li>
            Bug Fix: the HTML5 validator integration broke some of the
            validator's &ldquo;document type override&rdquo; functionalities in version
            0.8.4. This is fixed in 0.8.5.
          </li>
               <li>
            New: the validator icon code, which one can add to web pages, now
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=65252" shape="rect">includes XHTML+RDFa</a>
            when applicable.
          </li>
               <li>
            Bug Fix / New: implementing
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6329" shape="rect">XML::LibXML Structured Errors</a>.
            The validator uses libxml2 and the XML::LibXML for well-formedness
            check. Recent versions of the Perl library had bugs that made in
            backward incompatible, causing the validator to not output all
            well-formedness errors reliably. Some code was added to the
            validator to work with all future versions of that library, but
            we recommend not using XML::LibXML between versions 1.67 and 1.69
            inclusive
            (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6329#c15" shape="rect">see how</a>).
          </li>
               <li>
            Experimental: validation of SVG documents is now passed to the
            validator.nu engine. At the time of this release, neither
            validator.nu nor the DTD engine previously used are perfect for the
            validation of SVG, but the technologies used in the validator.nu
            engine (nvdl and relaxNG) makes it more promising.
          </li>
               <li>
            UI Fix: accessibility improvements for screen readers.
          </li>
               <li>
            Documentation: updated the
            <a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html" shape="rect">Why Validate?</a> document.
          </li>
               <li>
            Usability: the way in which the validator has to handle
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6259" shape="rect">direct
              input and character encodings</a> has long been confusing to
            many. Improvements have been made that explain in clearer ways what
            the validator does.
          </li>
               <li>
            New: the validator now recommends to declare character encoding in
            the document itself, especially if there is a chance that the
            document will be read from or saved to disk, CD, etc - in
            accordance with
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/#declaring" shape="rect">internationalization recommendations</a>.
          </li>
