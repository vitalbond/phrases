<div><p>When I released <a href="http://hackinghappy.com/">Hacking Happy</a> two weeks ago, I made a rather serious mistake. It’s the first time I’ve self-published in eBook format. I put a lot of effort into thinking through the release and marketing of the book, but one problem slipped through.</p>
<p>I believe that when you purchase a digital product, you are purchasing the content, not the format. I released Hacking Happy as an eBook in four different formats, each available for download at a minimum purchase price of $5. This was the easiest way to make the book available on <a href="http://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, and I didn’t think about it much. I thought it would look good on the home page to have links to several different formats! However, I didn’t consider that someone may want copies of the book in two different formats. There are various reasons they may want to do this, and I do not believe they should have to pay full price for each of the different formats when they are essentially getting the same content.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have now made Hacking Happy available as a <a href="http://gum.co/QGvT">zip file</a> of all four formats, in addition to the other download links. It is the same minimum price as the other links. However, this didn’t help anyone who had already supported me in buying the book in a single format. Luckily, Gumroad allows me to e-mail my buyers and I was able to supply them with a private link to the zipfile if they wish to access other formats.</p>
<p>Of course, since you own the content you purchased, you are welcome to convert it to other formats as you see fit!</p>
<p>The other issue people raised had more to do with marketing than the book itself. Part of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4866234">discussion</a> on Hacker News pointed out that the excerpt didn’t really say much about what was in the book. I have alleviated this by adding a table of contents to the excerpt link on the <a href="http://hackinghappy.com/">home page</a> and by choosing an excerpt from a chapter other than the introduction. I believe the chosen excerpt is representative of the contents of the book, and also highlights my writing style.</p>
<p>The response to this book has been very humbling. Other than complaints from people who chose not to purchase it, the feedback has been entirely positive. It has received one five star review on Amazon and I have received e-mails of support, congratulations, and gratitude. I knew when I wrote the book that it was necessary and would fill a niche, and I knew when I published it that I had done a good job. But the feedback reinforcing that knowledge has brought me as much happiness as the process of writing the book did!</p></div>
