<div><p>This week, I was finally able to fulfil a longstanding goal: to delete my Google account from my Android phone. This is a step in a <a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/tag/google/">series</a> of progressions towards “completely” disappearing from Google’s radar. I have been comfortable with the state of my laptop, which avoids all Google spyware using <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">ghostery</a> to block Google analytics, disabling cookies on all Google domains, and using <a href="https://startpage.com/">Startpage.com</a> for search. I’ve dropped Google Talk in favour of a jabber server hosted by a friend. While I still actively monitor my Gmail account via IMAP, it is not my primary address and is largely only used for correspondence that is already public, such as mailing lists and Google Groups.</p>
<p>The three things that I have still been using Google for were:</p>
<ul><li>Maps</li>
<li>Paid Apps From Google Play</li>
<li>Contact Backup</li>
</ul><p>I still use Google maps on occasion, though my main navigation equipment is an offline Garmin GPS device that — to the best of my knowledge — is not notifying anyone of my location at any time. I largely addressed the other two issues this past week.</p>
<p>I recently received my <a href="http://cubieboard.org/">Cubieboard</a> in the mail. It’s basically a specced up Raspberry PI. I installed <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/">Arch Linux</a> by following the instructions at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/cubieboard/other/SQVD3sCoWTg">this thread</a>.</p>
<p>I then set up <a href="http://owncloud.org/">Own Cloud</a> by following the instructions at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Owncloud">. Once it was set up, I realized that I personally don’t have much use for calendar sync or file sharing, but that the contact backup was crucial. I didn’t want a full LAMP stack running on my little ARM processor, so I uninstalled Own Cloud and set up </a><a href="http://radicale.org/">Radicale</a> instead. Now my phone’s contacts are backed up and I no longer need my Google account to support that feature.</p>
<p>Then I was notified that <a href="http://aokp.co/">AOKP</a>, my current Android ROM of choice, had released an update. I thought “Hm, I wonder if I can get away with not installing the Google Apps package at all.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t. But I tried. The main issue is that there are two paid apps in my Google Play account (SwiftKey and SwipePad MoreSpace) that I do not want to live without, and do not want to purchase again from another vendor. In the case of SwipePad, I couldn’t even find another vendor. I toyed with backing up and restoring the .apk’s, but I got certificate and signing errors. I’ve read that these can be circumnavigated with Titanium Backup, but I haven’t gotten around to trying it yet.</p>
<p>So I installed Google apps and reluctantly activated my Google Account to install these two paid apps. Then I disabled my Google Account.</p>
<p>I then installed <a href="http://www.aptoide.com/">Aptoide</a> to replace Google Play. It had recent versions of all the free apps I use on a regular basis. It looks like it will be able to supply my app needs into the future.</p>
<p>I have logged into my Gmail account and deleted my pre-existing contact list. This means that even if I do have to enable Google Play in the future, I will no longer be spammed with “Your friends like this app” messages. It also means Google will not be able to track my future relationships unless they are with people who use Google services.</p>
<p>Now if only Ghostery and Firefox would get Ghostery working on Android, I’d actually feel safe using my device!</p></div>
