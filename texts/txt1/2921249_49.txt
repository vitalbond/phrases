<div><p>Well as a CS student at my local community college here in Lakewood, Colorado. I noticed in my CS class that I amÂ  the only black man in the class. I was curious how come the Open Source World did not reach out to more urban males? I have been in touch with some good people at GNOME in particular the OPW program which is for women. Now they have given me good advice to look at GSOC. Can I ask why is there not a similar program for minorities I know this may not apply to all countries. I am talking in particular the US where I am based at. I have in the past been a contributor to Fedora and Arch Linux. I would like some more feedback on any programs for CS majors like myself or even school age children from the inner-city. This is good way to spark interest in the next generation of software engineers.</p></div>
