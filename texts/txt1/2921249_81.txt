<div><p>Hey all,</p>
<p>http://schwag.archlinux.ca has been down for at least a week. I&rsquo;m really sorry about that. I&rsquo;ve been working on transferring to a new web host and they were having trouble getting all the Python dependencies I needed.</p>
<p>My old host was based in the United States, and while they provided exceptionally good service for the price, I have become uncomfortable with storing any data in the US. The websites are not private, of course. However I am also hosting e-mail on these domains. As a Canadian citizen, I am not covered by the NSA&rsquo;s (possibly false) claim that they do not spy on US citizens, so I felt that I should store it in my own country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do anything that is currently illegal, but I don&rsquo;t know that these arrogant governments aren&rsquo;t going to change their laws to restrict my freedoms. I may not be a person of interest today, but I am outspoken about freedom, privacy, and transparency. This is currently legal and acceptable, but that may not always be the case and I want to be proactive about keeping my private data out of the hands of those who would use it against me.</p></div>
