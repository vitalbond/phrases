<div><p>I had a new experience last week: I installed OpenBSD. And wow, what an experience it was!</p>
<p>As a fan of trying new operating systems, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to &ldquo;learn BSD&rdquo; for many years now. I had decided a while back to try out FreeBSD because it has the largest user base, and assumed it would be the &ldquo;best BSD experience&rdquo; for me. Well, my experience with FreeBSD was that documentation was sorely lacking (despite hearing the contrary) and the things I was most interested in seemed to be in a state of flux, namely package management and compilers. That and the fact that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be &ldquo;one right way&rdquo; to do almost anything in FreeBSD caused me to never really understand what I was doing, no matter how hard I tried. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just an idiot. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, OpenBSD 5.4 just came out, and after reading a comment on OSNews from a fan absolutely gushing over it, I became really excited to try it out.</p>
<p>Now, I only knew a few things about OpenBSD:</p>
<ul><li>It&rsquo;s secure. Like, VERY secure.</li>
<li>The documentation is vast and superb.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not very popular, even in the list of not-very-popular operating systems.</li>
<li>The mascot is cute.</li>
</ul><p>I downloaded the latest release and read a bit of the installation guide. I was very impressed with the documentation, but not nearly as impressed as I was going to be after installing everything. One thing in particular stood out to me in the installation guide: the advice to install OpenBSD on an empty hard drive if it&rsquo;s your first time. Pshhh, I&rsquo;ve installed a million operating systems. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t hard, but it was very different from what I was used to. At one point near the end of the installation after configuring the partitions, I had no idea whether or not all my personal files were still on my hard drive. After wiping my sweaty palms together and rebooting my computer, it turns out I&rsquo;d done everything correctly and didn&rsquo;t erase anything. Well, I guess I should say OpenBSD did everything correctly. For all the power it provides, the installer really is pretty automatic and smart. Anyway, as a responsible computer user I of course have a recent backup too, but it&rsquo;s still nice to not have to need it.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s at this point that the documentation really impressed me. I finish the installation and reboot. I login and it tells me I have a new email that I can read with the &ldquo;mail&rdquo; command. The email gives a welcome and a ton of information, including the suggestion to read &ldquo;man afterboot&rdquo;. That man page gives even more instructions on how to do things people often want to do after an installation. Every command has a manual. Ever configuration file has a manual. The documentation just kept going and going! And it&rsquo;s all both high quality and current.</p>
<p>I installed a few applications with ease using the built in package manager. Although the X server is not &ldquo;part of&rdquo; the operating system, it was included in the install and was automatically configured.</p>
<p>I started X and had to laugh. OpenBSD is very much UNIX, and if ever I saw a GUI that screamed &ldquo;UNIX&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the default in OpenBSD.</p>

<p>I decided to keep it, just because it makes me feel all hardcore UNIXy.</p>
<p>Also, OpenBSD feels fast. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just in my head or what, but the Internet connection in particular just feels so smooth compared to Arch Linux.</p>
<p>And that was pretty much it. The Internet, video (including 3D Radeon drivers), and audio were all configured automatically. I&rsquo;m incredibly impressed with what I&rsquo;ve seen. I haven&rsquo;t decided where to go with OpenBSD from here, besides just &ldquo;learn it more&rdquo;, which I look forward to doing.</p>
