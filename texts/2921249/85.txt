<div><p>A couple weeks ago, I signed a contract with <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O&rsquo;Reilly</a> to publish a book inspired by my extremely popular <a href="http://archlinux.me/dusty/2013/06/13/creating-an-application-in-kivy-part-1/">Creating An Application In Kivy</a> blog series. On Monday, I start work at Facebook, a full-time salaried position that includes a substantial raise over my last position.</p>
<p>Signing these two contracts, two very traditional ways of obtaining money in exchange for services, is in stark contrast to the excitement I have held for the <a href="http://gittip.com/">Gittip</a> project. I marketed (some might say &lsquo;begged&rsquo;) for Gittip contributions in return for the service I performed in writing the  Kivy articles. Gittip provided; I really didn&rsquo;t expect to make more than a couple dollars per week, but my current income from Gittip is over $11 per week. I&rsquo;m touched and grateful for these donations, and I don&rsquo;t feel I deserve them at all, considering that I&rsquo;ll be spending most of my time on my new book and job for the next few months.</p>
<p>It would be easy to argue that Gittip has failed. If I had somehow made more money off Gittip, I might have chosen to publish a book under a creative commons license or through other platforms, rather than signing a traditional book contract. If I was making so much money off Gittip that I could have laughed off Facebook&rsquo;s salary and stayed out of the horrifically over-priced silicon valley, the open source world (and Facebook&rsquo;s competitors!) would certainly have benefited.</p>
<p>However, there is a better way to look at this. I have committed (to myself) to contribute a substantial portion of the royalties from my new book back to the Kivy team. I will naturally use Gittip to distribute these funds. I am also planning to increase my funding of other projects out of my Facebook salary, and I&rsquo;ll be using Gittip to fund the Arch Linux development team (if they ever set one up on Gittip) out of the income I already make from Arch Linux Schwag.</p>
<p>I believe one of the biggest problems Gittip has to solve is not increasing it&rsquo;s member base, but increasing the amount of money being injected into the system. If small tips are just moving from one open source developer to another and back again (I&rsquo;ve gotten into the unfortunate habit of regifting everything I make plus a few dollars), the money really has no value. It is a small gesture, but it&rsquo;s not something that can be turned into food on the table if everyone just turns around and gives it away. I would definitely like to live a life, someday, where my writing and coding activities are exciting enough to the world that my entire salary comes from Gittip. However, I think the best thing I can do for the tool right now is to put money in, rather than take it out.</p>
<p>So no, Gittip has not failed me. It is succeeding in a different way from what I originally anticipated. Nor am I selling out. I am excited and passionate about my. Gittip was designed to allow content creators to pursue their passions. I&rsquo;m able to do that within the traditional framework. I&rsquo;m very lucky to be able to express my gratitude for my current life in the form of microdonations to other developers.</p></div>
