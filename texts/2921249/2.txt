<div><p>My friend in college (2000) introduced me to Linux. Windows 98 was having a lot of trouble on my laptop, so, in my days of dial-up Internet, I drove an hour to a computer store to buy a boxes copy of <strong>Mandrake</strong> for (I think) $30.</p>
<p>When that laptop died I decided to buy a Fujitsu Lifebook (I cannot tell you how much I loved that laptop). Unfortunately, there was a bug in the Linux kernel at the time which prevented it from booting correctly on a Transmeta Crusoe processor. I found an tutorial describing how to patch and compile my own Linux kernel for the Crusoe using <strong>Slackware</strong>, and I began using that.</p>
<p>At that point point in time, Slackware had no package manager. Instead, when new software came out (and I love trying new software!) I would download and compile it myself, including all of it’s newly required libraries (GTK2, Pango, Atk…). I had heard about the popularity of <strong>Debian</strong> and gave it a try. The feeling of using a package manager again to automatically install and update everything felt so incredibly wonderful.</p>
<p>I became tired of the cycle of Debian stable being fresh and new and being tired and old, so I tried <strong>Ubuntu</strong>. I didn’t want to like it because it was “too easy”, but my gosh, it was just so easy. My favorite version is still 8.04 Hardy Heron, which I still consider the pinnacle of Ubuntu development.</p>
<p>At this point I began to really learn about the Free Software Foundation, and decided that I agree with many of their beliefs. So, I installed a new FSF approved version of Hardy Heron called <strong>gNewSense</strong> and used only free and open source software on my computer for almost a year. You might be surprised how much Linux software is “open source” but not FSF “free”. <img src="http://archlinux.me/drcouzelis/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley">  Anyway, it was a great experience.</p>
<p>gNewSense became old, and I didn’t like the direction the distribution was going. I wanted the latest versions of software, but I was tired of always formatting and installing new operating systems. I then discovered <strong>Arch Linux</strong> and the concept of a rolling release distribution. In addition to that, I was really getting into contributing to the Linux community, and the Arch Linux community provides outstanding outlets for that: a strong forum, a highly regarded wiki, and the AUR (allowing anyone to contribute new software packages to the distribution), all of which can be contributed to almost instantly by anyone.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p>I was <strong>introduced</strong> to Linux using Mandrake.</p>
<p>I <strong>learned</strong> Linux using Slackware.</p>
<p>I discovered <strong>package management</strong> using Debian.</p>
<p>I took a break and used the <strong>user friendly</strong> Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I became passionate about <strong>software freedom</strong> using gNewSense.</p>
<p>I keep <strong>current</strong> and in <strong>control</strong> using Arch Linux.</p>
<p>I used each of those distributions for at least about a year. I’ve been using the same 64-bit Arch Linux installation for three years now and am very happy with it. I dual boot the Haiku operating system. And I still consider myself a freetard. <img src="http://archlinux.me/drcouzelis/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"></p>
