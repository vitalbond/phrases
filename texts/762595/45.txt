One of many reasons we recommend working with a professional on the design is that you'll also have an expert on your remodeling team who may be able to provide a lot of answers to many of the questions that need to be answered.<br><br>If you forge ahead on your own, keep a notebook. Go around your existing kitchen and write down what you see. Sink, window, wall, Kitchenaid mixer (a tall item that needs to be put or stored somewhere in your new kitchen), water filter, baking pans, flooring, outlet, large utensils, etc. <br><br>Each item is something to consider in your remodel. Many are simply "items that need storage." Some are contractor issues, such as an outlet in the wrong place. Some are design issues, such as "where will the Kitchenaid mixer go."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Remodeling Budget Guide on Kindle
