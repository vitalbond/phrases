There's a sale coming so if you've been planning an IKEA kitchen project, take note. The sale starts July 4 and runs until August 19. The details or discount structure hasn't yet been announced but no matter, these sales are almost always the best deal in town for kitchen remodels.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">The best time to order, during a sale, is towards the beginning.&nbsp;</span>If you are going to buy your cabinets during this upcoming summer sale, it would be best to get the layout design started now. If you run into trouble with the online IKEA software or just know you want professional design, and would like a referral to a qualified IKEA designer, feel free to call or write me (971-313-4449 or info@modernfamilykitchens.com).<br /><br />I've published a comprehensive article for Kindle: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088PEHTO" target="_blank">HOW TO PLAN YOUR BUDGET for an IKEA KITCHEN REMODEL</a>.&nbsp;It's meant to provide expert knowledge on estimating and budgeting the materials and labor. The most frequently asked questions I get are about costs and it's just not something I can answer lightly and feel I've helped someone. Each project is unique and the costs can vary widely. The price tags at IKEA are for cabinets and countertop only and thus are not that helpful when what you need to know is how much EVERYTHING is going to cost, <i>all materials</i> plus <i>all labor </i>needed to get the result you want. My hope is that this Kindle (or Kindle apps) article saves you worry, time and money.<br /><br />There are several reasons to get started as soon as possible if you want to order your cabinets during the sale. First, you have the longest runway before ordering. You want as much time as possible to plan the project, including but not limited to the budget, get the design finalized, line up a contractor, and order non-IKEA materials. <br /><br />IKEA kitchen experts, designers and contractors, get booked up quickly once the sale starts. The design resources I have are able to get a kitchen designed in a day if they have measurements. But why not give yourself a week or more, to study the design work, map it out perhaps on your kitchen floor and walls, revise, ask questions that come up, shop for tile and revisit IKEA to confirm your choices. After all, there's lots of money involved, tearing your house apart involved, and quite a few factors to coordinate.<br /><br />Once you have ordered the cabinets delivery is often within two weeks. You can sometimes get delivery sooner but once the sale is underway, delivery timeframes can get longer. IKEA will not hold an order for long. Once the delivery date is set, either you have to have some place to store them convenient to the kitchen (say, your garage) or you need to have the contractor scheduled on, or right before, or after, delivery.<br /><br />The best way we've found, as a contractor, if there is no garage in which to store and build the cabinets, &nbsp;for example in a condo, is to start the project about two days before the cabinets will be delivered. If there are to be wall changes, electrical re-wiring or flooring installed before cabinets, a contractor might need as much as a week of work before being ready for the cabinets.<br /><br />Your delivery, even for a small kitchen, is going to be massive. IKEA cabinets come completely disassembled. Expect a pallet of flat, heavy cardboard boxes, sometimes two for larger kitchens. This is something to consider in your planning.<br /><br />My other posts discuss contractors, finding one and working with one. My suggestion is not to expect IKEA to provide the data, nor the contractor, needed. The companies contracted with IKEA to install their cabinets are likely to sub-contract everything else. Most projects, 95%, require some demo and wall repair, wiring, and plumbing. These require expert skills, and the latter two require permits and inspections. The best contractor in most cases is one who can do everything expertly. Second best is a contractor who will do everything except assemble and install the IKEA cabinets. In this case, you can work with the IKEA-affiliated installer or another proven IKEA installer in your area. I have some resources in this regard for those in the Los Angeles area that I am happy to pass on.<br /><br />A very smart "test" when you are interviewing contractors is to ask about permits. A contractor who says "you don't need one" is almost always operating illegally so don't hire him. A contractor who does not pull permits is suspect, so find out why and if his answers satisfy you, make sure you can pull your own permits before hiring him. A contractor who will pull permits and who includes the cost of doing so as a line item in his bid is best.<br /><br />Ask the potential contractor for a copy of his license, liability insurance, and worker's comp policy (if he has employees). Keep these in a folder with the contract which, you must, must, must get. A contract that lists the exact project specs and the cost of getting these done is vital. Check your state's contractor license board for more data on hiring contractors.<br /><br />Once you have a contractor lined up and your design work done, you are ready to order materials, including your cabinets. If you are buying everything at IKEA, it's easy. If you are buying some materials, for example tile and light fixtures, elsewhere, order these in advance so they are onsite (in your home) when your contractor needs them. If your contractor is installing new appliances, they can be delivered at any point in advance. It is usually best, for a kitchen remodel, to buy appliances without paying extra for installation. This is because the appliance delivery date may arrive and the kitchen may not be ready for the appliances. Most stores will deliver and install in one trip and if you aren't ready for installation, you'll pay more for a return trip.<br /><br />I hope these quick tips help you get ready for the sale! IKEA has lots and lots of inventory of everything so don't worry about that. Just get the design done and research materials and contractors this month.<br /><br />Susan<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Remodeling Budget Guide on Kindle
