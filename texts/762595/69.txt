Here's the window of opportunity to save on IKEA kitchen cabinets, countertops and appliances. The sale runs until December 1. It is always better to order earlier in the sale than towards the end.<br><br>Here is IKEA's discount structure for this sale, same as the summer 2013 sale<br><h4><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13.90625px;">● Spend $3500 or more on your new kitchen and save 10% on your entire kitchen purchase.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13.90625px;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 13.90625px;">● Spend $4500 or more on your new kitchen and save 20% on your entire kitchen purchase.</span></h4><div>Many of my blog posts cover how to plan an IKEA kitchen project, find a contractor, design the layout, order your IKEA materials and other materials, and how the process works, overall. I've done hundreds of IKEA kitchens and worked on thousands of IKEA kitchen designs, so I'm pretty good.</div><div><br></div><div>The key really is having a correct, elegantly designed layout. Even if you have a small kitchen, even if your budget is tight, even if you are keeping the same footprint, it is vital to have an expert help you create the optimal layout. The cost of professional design help will pay you back many times over.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A lot of people ask me about timeframes. I recommend taking a minimum of two weeks to work with your kitchen designer (at least, if you use my company's services). We can get you through the design process in two DAYS (with our Elite service) but it's really good to review our initial design work, and have time to shop, consider options, revise and adjust the plan until it is truly perfect for you. We want you to order confidently, knowledgeably and excitedly, too!</div><div><br></div><div>During the design process you want to be looking at IKEA materials online or in the store, to best consider the designer's recommendations and the design itself. The design process is really a communication process, and the more you know, the more precise the layout and design choices will be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once you have the design work, you'll also have a schematic showing cabinet placements and measurements (again, if you work with us, not all designers might provide this). This makes it easier to get contractor bids because you can show the contractor the specs of the finished kitchen. For example, knowing the final cabinet layout, the contractor can correctly estimate electrical, plumbing, wallboard, and many other items on the bid. Without a correct layout, with the finished requirements unknown, the contractor always bids higher. I was a contractor, I know this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, planning can take a month. This includes, design, finding a contractor, choosing appliances, tile flooring, etc. Some projects have a week or two or more of prep work, such are removing walls, before cabinets can be installed. Once they are installed, countertop, sink, faucet and finish work can take a few days or week, to a month or more. Always insist that a timeframe is specified in your labor services (contractor) contract. You can deduct a specified charge for each day over that specified finish date if you and the contractor have agreed to this in the contract.</div><div><br></div><div>Typical projects of 18-23 cabinets should take one to three weeks from demo to completion. You would want to order your cabinets 1-2 weeks before the demo of the old kitchen begins. Backtracking, start the design process two weeks to a month before ordering. Our designers can get your design done in a day, but you really want time to enjoy the creative process and the knowledge you will gain from working with a professional kitchen designer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Susan</div><div><br><br>P.S.
