It's usually more complex than choosing and buying a car, even though, with IKEA kitchen projects, a car can cost considerably more. </div><div><br></div><div>I speak with many homeowners who are really nervous about, even overwhelmed by, the prospect of remodeling their kitchens. I do all I can to help calm the waters by providing data, facts and knowledge, which is the best way I know to alleviate the worry of uncertainty. In fact, this is why I write this blog. </div><div><br></div><div>With an IKEA kitchen project, you can do a great kitchen remodel for a very reasonable cost but the same factors come into play with any kitchen remodel. Your budget has to be sufficient, something you  have to work out in advance. You also need to decide on various materials such as cabinet styles, appliances, tile, flooring, lighting, and more. </div><div><br></div><div>You also need to design the kitchen layout, which can be hugely stressful in itself, and why I recommend working with a professional. After all, the layout is going to determine most of the other factors. </div><div><br></div><div>The best tips I can offer to avoid or minimize stress are these:</div><div><br></div><div>1) Do enough research well in advance of your project. Enough means you feel confident you know what you need to know. If you don't know, and can't find out with research, find a professional to help you.</div><div><br></div><div>2) Consider that IKEA is a cabinet warehouse, not a service provider. Your local store may offer referrals to designers or installers, but these are usually bare bones services and you'll have to run the show. </div><div><br></div><div>3) Use the help and expertise of professionals. It is always worth it. Ask around and find a local, independent licensed contractor, or several, and meet them and get bids. Hire a professional IKEA kitchen designer, like my company. The difference is huge when you have reliable professionals. </div><div><br></div><div>4) Don't ask for the opinions of too many others. Decide what you like and what you want and go ahead and get these things. Too many cooks spoil the soup, and back seat kitchen remodeling drivers can drive you crazy (what a mix of maxims!)</div><div><br></div><div>5) Stay well within your budget. Pay cash if you can. </div><div><br></div><div>6) Keep it simple. There can be 100 factors in a kitchen remodel, or there can be 10. You control the complexity, not the other way around. </div><div><br></div><div>7) Use my free eBook to sort out all the costs before you buy anything. Know before you go. </div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><div><br></div><div>Susan</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
