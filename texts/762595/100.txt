<div>&nbsp;(Request my free eBook,&nbsp;<a href="https://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/so50erv15p9pz4/" target="_blank">How to Budget for an IKEA Kitchen Remodel</a>)<br><br>This is the big question right now. I get asked a few times each day by people who call for design services. Most realize it's a good idea to get their planning and design done ahead of time, but knowing when the sale prices will next be available is important to many.<br><br>IKEA doesn't announce sales until it announces sales. In some stores, staff will tell you what they know, but it's often kept hushed up.<br><br>Historically, in the US, there's a fall sale in October/November and a Spring sale in March/April. Usually there is a summer sale, too. It's often shorter. Sometimes the discount structure is different than it was in the Spring sale (10% for purchases (cabinets, countertops, appliances are included) of $3500, 20% if you spend $4500.<br><br>Is there going to be a sale in July? Probably. Should you get your planning started so that you are ready? Definitely. It's better to place your order at the beginning of a sale, than at the end. It's really stressful to be planning and designing 5 days before a sale is over!<br><br>A good design process can't be done in one day. Even if IKEA will send someone to your house to do it all in a few hours, that's not a professional service. It takes a few weeks to draft, review, revise and polish a kitchen design. If you want an elegant, optimal layout, creatively designed and a joy to use when finished, spend some time sorting out all the details, confirming the sizes and styles and options you really want.<br><br>Susan<br><br>PS.
