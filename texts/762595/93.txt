Here's my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.timetrade.com/book/T4DNM" target="_blank">calendar</a>, just pick a time that works for you.<br><br>The IKEA US Kitchen Sale for Spring 2014 has started. Mark your calendar, it starts February 28 and will run for until April 27.<br><br><div class="p1">If your total purchase is $3,500.00 (including kitchen cabinets, appliances, counter tops), you get a 10% discount. If your total purchase is $4,500 you can get a 20% discount.</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">An average kitchen requires 18 cabinets total, top and bottom. The cost of your cabinets will vary (a lot) with the door style you choose. Countertop is another big variable. You could spend $200 for laminate or butcher block, or $3000+ for solid surface types (like Casearstone) for the same square footage.<br><br>Most kitchen purchases will easily top $3,500-$4,500, so by ordering during the sale period you can save $500-$900 or more.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">There are many ways to get the best benefit from the sale. The methods vary with the type of project and purchase. For example, sometimes buying something extra you don't necessarily need can boost your sale discount. You can then sell that item on Craigslist or give it as a gift. We show our clients how to best take advantage of the sale discounts.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Now is the time to get started on the planning and design phase. First, get our free eBook,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=%22http://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/r7x2q5/%22%3EFill%20out%20my%20form!%3C/a%3E" target="_blank">How to Budget for an IKEA Kitchen Remodel</a>. This will help you know what the real costs are, both labor and materials.<br><br></div><div class="p1"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-guA5n-RuLYM/UTEU5cQXfJI/AAAAAAAAAFA/cusCOr2Mrsg/s1600/fy2013_wk09_ikea_hpb_kitchen_offer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-guA5n-RuLYM/UTEU5cQXfJI/AAAAAAAAAFA/cusCOr2Mrsg/s320/fy2013_wk09_ikea_hpb_kitchen_offer.jpg" height="123" width="320"></a></div><div class="p1">The next step is to plan the layout. That's what my company does, so contact us if you would like help. I offer <a href="https://www.timetrade.com/book/T4DNM" target="_blank">a free, no-obligation 30-minute consultation</a> to my blog readers.<br><br>&nbsp;An expert and carefully checked layout plan is vital for the next step, which is getting labor bids. A contractor needs to know what the cabinet placement will be in order to give you a comprehensive, and thus accurate, bid.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">The sale, running for eight weeks, really is the best time to order, but only if you can either launch the project during or right after delivery (usually 1-2 weeks after ordering) or if you have a storage place that is dry. Timing is part of the planning. If you can order in the first half of the sale, you'll run into less of a crowd, less wait time for delivery and less likelihood of backordered parts.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Keep in mind that during sales, all IKEA kitchen departments and even all IKEA kitchen pros, get very busy. The best time to order is early in the sale, when stocks are high, wait times are minimal, and you can schedule to suit your own preferences, rather than having to wait for a contractor or installer.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Ready, set.....<br><br>Susan<br><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Website:&nbsp;<span class="s2"><a href="http://www.modernfamilykitchens.com/">www.modernfamilykitchens.com</a></span></span></div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p2"><br></div><div class="p3"><br></div><div class="p2"><br></div><div class="p2"><br></div></div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1"><br></div><br><div class="p1"></div><br><div class="p1" style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;"><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
