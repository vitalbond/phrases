You want a new kitchen (a lot). You see the display kitchens at IKEA or in their catalog and you know that's what you want. You even have the money, or you think you might have enough. But you can't seem to get started. What's the problem?<br><br>Usually when someone can't get a project they want to do underway it is simply a matter of "missing data." With an IKEA kitchen project, it's easy to think that IKEA has all the answers. After all, those displays look like finished kitchens.<br><br>Always remember that IKEA's purpose, not a bad one, is to sell you IKEA products. The store and its personnel are not in the service sector (not really) or the information business, nor are they remodeling professionals. IKEA sells great cabinets and I recommend them wholeheartedly. But if you can't get your project going, you might have the idea that IKEA will provide more help, adequate help, and vital help at that. When it is not forthcoming, you can get stalled. it could even be hard to spot what the problem is, but more often than not, it's just a lack of data.<br><br>People need an answer, first of all, to "how much will it cost?” they mean the whole project, not just the cabinets.<br><br>More than likely, you have seen the IKEA ads which show a part of a lovely kitchen and an advertised price of well under $3000. Although it surely gets your attention, it’s a bit deceptive. This price is merely the cost of the visible cabinets in that ad. It rarely includes appliances, countertop and other materials, like backsplash tile or light fixtures. You may have figured this out because who believes advertising anyway?<br><br>The problem is that you need to know, but don't know, or don't feel confident you know, how much your MATERIALS will cost (which means you need a comprehensive list of what those materials will be), AND you need to know how much LABOR will cost, to install all those materials.<br><br>You might also have tried to design you cabinet layout with the IKEA planner tool online, which also leaves you uncertain. Will the cabinets really fit? Did I do it right? Is the list that is generated complete or do I need to buy other parts, and if so, how do I figure out which ones?<br><br>If any of this hits home, if you are stuck in an information vacuum in which the only thing you know for sure is that you like and want IKEA cabinets, you simply need to get more data.<br><br>My company's Professional Design Service is available to get you launched and where you want to go, so call if you want experts to talk to, at least to get unstuck.<br><br>Call a few local contractors and if any seem trustworthy, ask for a bid on your project. A bid, even early on, will give you at least an estimate of labor costs. Keep in mind that some contractors will advise against IKEA cabinets because they sell another brand or because they are not familiar with IKEA's line. Just say thank you, and carry on with your goal to complete a beautiful new IKEA kitchen.<br><br><br><br><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
