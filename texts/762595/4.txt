Along with the many creative choices a homeowner has while kitchen remodeling, there are a few choices that can result in better health for you, for your family and for our planet.<br /><br />My top suggestion, whether or not you are remodeling your kitchen, is to invest in an under-sink water filtration system. The plastic canister types are also good (Brita, etc,) but not as convenient. A high quality under-sink filter can cost as little as $75 (check out what Sears has to offer). Installation costs vary but expect to pay about $250.  Reverse osmosis systems cost upwards of $300 plus installation. Do the research and pick a product that suits your needs.<br /><br />Here are some benefits:<br /><br />1) you can use tap water for cooking and drinking again!<br />2) your water tastes better<br />3) your coffee tastes better<br />4) you don't have to carry home plastic water bottles<br />5) you avoid the health risks associated with plastic water bottles<br />6) you don't contribute to the problem of plastic water bottles that take 1000 years to <span style="font-style: italic;">begin</span> to decompose. In 2006, 38 billion plastic water bottles ended up in U.S. landfills.<br />7) you save money. Bottled water costs between $1 and $4 per gallon, (90 percent of the cost is in the bottle, lid and label)<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
