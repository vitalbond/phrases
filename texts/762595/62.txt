If you want that 20% discount, now is the time to get your layout done and contractor bids in.<br><br>Most of the wonderful people who call us, Modern Family Kitchens, that is, already know that IKEA cabinets are awesome: great value, high quality, sustainable materials, excellent warranty. But there is always some confusion that boils down to: HOW?<br><br>It's one thing to walk into IKEA and buy some salad bowls or a bookcase. It's something entire different to order the materials for a kitchen remodel. It's easy to think others must know something you don't know. Having worked on hundreds of IKEA kitchen projects as the owner of a remodeling company, I can tell you that it is a simple matter of walking into an IKEA and buy some "stuff."<br><br>Our design services are meant to handle a lot of the confusion. First, you must have a layout to order IKEA cabinets. Second, our design process itself will answer many of the questions homeowners have. Third, once you see the design proposal, so many of your concerns will melt away and be replaced by enthusiasm: "Wow, look at this new kitchen we're going to have!"<br><br>We offer a free 30-minute phone consultation. There's no obligation to use our design services, you can just have a chance to ask any questions you have, especially those that are hanging you up. Here are some common questions people ask:<br><br>1) How do I find a contractor (let's talk about this)<br>2) How do I order cabinets if I live 2 hours (or more) from an IKEA store (answer: we'll help you)<br>3) Do I have to buy IKEA appliances (answer: no)<br>4) Will you provide a list of what I need to buy at IKEA? (answer: of course!)<br><br><br>In any case, if you are going to order during the current sale, it's really time to get the design work underway. You want some time to review the designer's work, to look at cabinets and appliances again, now that you have a design in hand. You want time to revise and refine.<br><br>Susan Wain<br><a href="http://www.modernfamilykitchens.com/">www.modernfamilykitchens.com</a><br>1-877-550-1753<br><br><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
