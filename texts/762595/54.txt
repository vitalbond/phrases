<div>We helped quite a few clients from all over the US and Canada design and order their new kitchens during the Spring 2013  IKEA Kitchen Sale. One client called for the first time just four days before the sale ended. They had requested my <a href="https://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/r7x2q5/" target="_blank">free IKEA kitchen budgeting eBook</a> and then called a few days later.<br><br>The couple had been working on their design using the online planner for over a year. They didn't think it would be possible for a designer to now understand their entire project and to sort out all the issues in just a few days. But they took a leap of faith in us.<br><br>Here's their thank you note:<br><br><br><div class="p1"><i>We were able to catch the ikea sale today!  Thank you so much for helping us achieve what we thought would be impossible in such a short time frame. We really appreciate you working on this last minute project and being so responsive.</i></div><div class="p1"><i><br></i></div><div class="p1"><i>...you guys provide a great service and we're so glad we stumbled across your blog.

Kitchen design is a professional skill. I will say this again, is SO worthwhile to invest a small part of your budget in professional design service. The difference, in the finished result, is huge. </div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">If you didn't get to order during this current sale, fear not. Another IKEA kitchen sale is coming soon, likely this summer. The best time to start your design work is one to two months before ordering. </div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Susan</div><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
