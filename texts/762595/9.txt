The season is almost upon us for butterflies, sprouting plants, warmer breezes, cherry blossoms. But none of these have our attention the way the IKEA kitchen sale does, also coming each spring.<br /><br />We can hardly blame those who will wait till the sale starts to order their cabinets. Here is the general idea of the sale:<br /><br />10% off cabinets and countertop<br />15% off if you buy 2 appliances also<br />20% off if you buy 3 appliances<br /><br />As always I highly recommend having an expert IKEA designer do the layout for you. Spending hours perched at IKEA computer stations is no fun. Having an expert designer come to your house, listen to you, answer your questions, and design several options, provide you with cost data, is the best investment you'll make. <br /><br />Save on the sale, don't skimp on a do-it-yourself design. If you are anywhere in SoCal, give us a call, 626-203-1480. Outside SoCal, our designer can either travel to you or work with your measurements. Ours is the least costly service of its type, the most comprehensive and, more important, we really want you to love your new kitchen. <br /><br />Susan<div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Remodeling Budget Guide on Kindle
