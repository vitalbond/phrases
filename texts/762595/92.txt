If you are trying to find out WHEN the NEXT IKEA KITCHEN SALE will be, that data has not yet been made public by IKEA. It's likely to be late Feb, early March. The discount structure could be different but you can usually save 10-20% by ordering during a sale. I recommend doing your research, budgeting and design work now, per the posts on this blog, and being ready to move forward as soon as the sale is announced.&nbsp;</i><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="color: black;"><i>See my other blog posts to understand when it's worth waiting for a sale, and when it's not. Or write me, I'll help). </i></span> </span><br><br><br>The sale dates have been announced! Mark your calendar, it starts March 28on the West Coast of the US (other cities &nbsp;can have other dates,) and will run for about eight weeks.<br><br>Each sale is a little different but the data promoted for this Spring 2013 sale is as follows:<br><br><div class="p1">If your total purchase is $3,500.00 (including kitchen cabinets, appliances, counter tops, interior fittings), you can get a 15% discount. If your total purchase is $4,500 you can get a 20% discount.</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">An average kitchen requires 18 cabinets total, top and bottom. The cost of your cabinets will vary (a lot) with the door style you choose. Countertop is another big variable. You could spend $200 for laminate or butcher block, or $3000+ for solid surface types (like Casearstone) for the same square footage.<br><br>Most kitchen purchases will easily top $3,500-$4,500, so by ordering during the sale period you can save $500-$900 or more.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">There are many ways to get the best benefit from the sale. The methods vary with the type of project and purchase. For example, sometimes buying something extra you don't necessarily need can boost your sale discount. You can then sell that item on Craigslist or give it as a gift. We show our clients how to best take advantage of the sale discounts.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Now is the time to get started on the planning and design phase.

That's what we do, so contact us if you would like help (We offer a free, no-obligation 30-minute consultation). An expert and carefully checked layout plan is vital for the next step, which is getting labor bids. A contractor needs to know what the cabinet placement will be in order to give you a comprehensive, and thus accurate, bid.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">The sale, running for eight weeks, really is the best time to order, but only if you can either launch the project during or right after delivery (usually 1-2 weeks after ordering) or if you have a storage place that is dry. Timing is part of the planning.</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Keep in mind that during sales, all IKEA kitchen departments and even all IKEA kitchen pros, get very busy. The best time to order is early in the sale, when stocks are high, wait times are minimal, and you can schedule to suit your own preferences, rather than having to wait for a contractor or installer.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Ready, set.....<br><br><div class="p1"><br></div>If you'd like to discuss your project with me, I can offer you a free, 30-minute phone consultation.
