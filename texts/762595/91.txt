But that doesn't mean that many people have not waited for the sale start tomorrow. The savings on a typical kitchen purchase (cabinets, counter top and/or appliances) can be worth waiting for if you plan to remodel your kitchen (or other areas of your house) with IKEA kitchen cabinets.<br><br>The one tip I can offer tonight is to get your planning (by which I mean contractor bids and kitchen design) before you go into IKEA.

Get the design and sort out the costs before you go to order.<br><br>I have ordered many IKEA kitchens.

We make sure their plan is correct, will fit, will work, is a beautiful, symmetrical, stylish, warm, contemporary and welcoming space for their lives.<br><br>We send them off at the end of the design process with a complete order list. Every cabinet, every panel, every door, drawer front, handle and knob. All neatly listed. And uploaded to the IKEA computer system so that most of it is already typed in when they arrive to the store. Do you know how long it can take a young IKEA co-worker, as they are called, to type in an entire kitchen order? <br><br>I am bragging, I am trying to point out an extra benefit of investing in professional design. But if you've been reading my blog, you already know.<br><br>Today, one day pre-sale. I looked over three plans that clients had draw up in the IKEA online planner. All three knew they could not move forward with the ambiguous fit, troubling asymmetry, and inelegance of their IKEA planner draft. One told me she felt the IKEA planner was a disservice because it limits and regulates the creativity needed to design a truly wonderful kitchen using IKEA's truly wonderful cabinets<br><br>The sale starts tomorrow, it lasts almost 8 weeks.
