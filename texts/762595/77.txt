<div>(Request my&nbsp;<a href="https://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/r7x2q5/" target="_blank">free IKEA kitchen budgeting eBook</a>)<br><br>I've written several posts about finding and hiring contractors but since I've gotten a few inquiries recently about this, I wanted to write a bit more.<br><br>Homeowners often save up for years to do a kitchen remodel. Since the beautiful model kitchens in IKEA stores seem to cost $5000 or less, one gets the idea that this is the actual cost of a kitchen remodel.<br><br>It's true that you can do a small kitchen for under $5000 if you do it yourself. Obviously the cabinets can cost half that or less so if you supply your own labor, it's possible. This means you do your own demo, have a way to haul off the trash generated (a bin rental can cost $500 or more in some cities), know how to do electrical, plumbing, appliance installation. You also have to know some carpentry to do a good job installing IKEA cabinets. It's simple, but the finish details of trim and molding make a big difference in the finished look, and these take skill. <br><br>However, the typical IKEA kitchen remodel costs $10,000 to $15,000. The materials for a full remodel, meaning cabinets, countertop, appliances and miscellaneous (tile, light fixtures, sink/faucet, flooring etc.) cost half. And labor accounts for the rest.<br><br>It is important to know that your labor costs are likely to be as much as, or more, than your materials costs if you want a licensed contractor with the skills and crew to do your project quickly, professionally, and with insurance and permits. If you haven't got the budget for this, it's better to wait until you do. <br><br>It's always a good idea to get more than one bid. The cheapest is rarely the best one to choose. Note that a good contractor can sense "price shoppers" on the phone. He can tell if someone is looking for the lowest price more than quality of work or good service and reputation. Consider that a good contractor doesn't want to drive to your house, spend time inspecting and talking with you, and then preparing an intelligent and comprehensive bid, all for free, if he considers that you won't accept his bid because you are really just looking for the lowest price.<br><br>The contractor you want is the one with experience, confidence, and know-how. You want a legal, licensed, bonded and insured person, who is polite, cheerful, helpful and trustworthy. Be willing to pay him a fair price for his work so that he can make a living and remain cheerful.<br><br>Rather than looking for the cheapest labor, one way to save money on labor is to do your research and understand the laws and rules for remodeling and permits in your local area. Once you have this knowledge, you can be more causative in choosing a contractor. <br><br>Compile a list of the services you know you'll need done (demo, trash removal, wall repair, adding outlets, appliance installation, etc.) and make sure your kitchen design is correct and complete. A remodeling contract that is comprehensive, that includes all that will be done, will cost less than a project with multiple change orders. No one can predict&nbsp; with 100% accuracy, but the more you know, the more data you have before the project starts, the more control you have over costs.<br><br>I wrote an eBook a few years ago to help homeowners estimate labor costs.
