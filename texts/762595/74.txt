If you are reading this, you might wonder how to get an order for cabinets placed and save the 15-20% before the sale end. It's entirely doable!<br><br>The key, of course, is to design the layout optimally and correctly. Once you have that done, the next step is to create an order list of the components you need to buy. The online IKEA planner seems to do this, but the list it generates is woefully incomplete. The online planner is also not a design tool and should only be used (optionally) to sketch out a general layout to help you communicate with your designer.<br><br>The key to a short design/order phase is enlisting the help of professionals. My company provides design and order support. Your contractor, if he's IKEA-cabinet-savvy, might also be able to help. Doing it yourself with the minimal support IKEA sales personnel provide is another option, but not the best. The less time you have, the more important it is to use the experience and skill of professionals.<br><br>One great thing about IKEA is that they don't run out of stock. You can place your order on December 1st, and although you might wait a few more days for delivery compared to someone who placed an order at the beginning of the sale in October, you'll still get all your stuff. One exception might be a backordered door or drawer front. This can happen at any point, sale or no sale, and does not hang up installation. You'll get everything you need to install your kitchen (if you ordered correctly) although you might be missing a front piece for a week or two. No biggie.<br><br>If you do order as the sale draws to a close, be prepared to spend half a day or more at IKEA. It's busy, the kitchen department staff are often harried. Make sure you go prepared, especially with a complete and correct order list. Note that things like drawer inserts or cabinet lights are not delivered with your kitchen cabinets. You take these smaller items home with you. You can always get them another time, or even order them online. Make the order of your cabinets, and countertop and appliances if you are also buying those, your target for the day.<br><br>I often recommend, in my motherly way, that clients eat a good breakfast, take some B vitamins, and bring water, when they go to IKEA to order. Getting a good night's sleep beforehand is also really helpful.<br><br>I hope I didn't make it seem like a battle to order an IKEA kitchen towards the end of a sale. It's not that hard.<br><br>Call or write me if you need some help, 1-877-550-1753 or <a href="mailto:info@modernfamilykitchens.com">info@modernfamilykitchens.com</a><br><br>-Susan<br><br>(Request my&nbsp;<a href="https://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/r7x2q5/" target="_blank">free IKEA kitchen budgeting eBook</a>)<br><br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3BL5xATasYE/UoP65aAMhVI/AAAAAAAAATg/QBHTt7INKcM/s1600/Combs+top+view.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="321" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3BL5xATasYE/UoP65aAMhVI/AAAAAAAAATg/QBHTt7INKcM/s640/Combs+top+view.jpg" width="640"></a></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
