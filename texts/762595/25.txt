<div>An IKEA kitchen remodel is a bit of an oddity compared to the typical  (and much more expensive) kitchen remodel. With an IKEA project,  homeowners need a lot more knowledge to get results as beautiful as  those IKEA display kitchens, to stay within their budgets and to have a  calm remodeling experience. <br><br>With just a few off-the-shelf  exceptions, the majority of kitchen remodels are done by a contractor  who supplies the cabinets and other materials. Often, homeowner hires a  kitchen cabinet company, perhaps choosing cabinets and/or appliances  from their showroom and catalogs, and the store’s employees or an  affiliated contractor do the design and labor. Sometimes the design  service is “free,” but, of course, you pay for the design service in the price of the cabinets. <br><br>With IKEA kitchens, homeowners first  recognize the value and beauty of IKEA cabinets. The IKEA stores provide  only minimal design help and customer support. Homeowners are expected  to design and to figure out the process on their own. Most IKEA stores  have contracted installers, and sometimes a designer you can hire, but these are often are bones services, often impersonal and rushed, and the rates are not lower, but often  higher, than other expert service providers.<br><br>I can often help a reader locate a designer or contractor but I wanted to point out the significant benefits of working with an expert when planning and designing your project.<br><br>What are the benefits of working with a professional IKEA kitchen designer?<br><br>1) You plan your project with the expertise and foresight gained from hundreds of similar IKEA kitchen projects completed by the designer.<br><br>2) You get insider, detailed knowledge of IKEA cabinets and related products<br><br>3) Your designer knows how to customized IKEA cabinets for irregular spaces or special requirements. You are not limited to stock sizes in designing the perfect layout for your new kitchen. <br><br>4) You have ongoing, expert support from planning through completion.<br><br>5) You have a design liaison to your installation contractor.<br><br>6) Your IKEA ordering experience will be easier and faster. A comprehensive IKEA order list will be compiled and reviewed by your designer before you order. You will have special instructions for the store for any customized cabinets in your layout (which require detailed knowledge of component parts).<br><br>7) Professional assistance is essential for clients who live far from IKEA stores. Your designer will help ensure the materials you order will allow for adjustments needed or wanted during installation, avoiding mid-project delays.<br><br>Sometimes there may be no truly qualified IKEA design professional in given area or city, but designers who know their stuff can work with you via email and phone, and provide the same support and creative design. If you can measure a wall, and email a photo, you can work with the best designers no matter where you live.<br><br>I hope you decide that expert support for your project from an experienced professional is indeed the best way to go. Even a small project on a tight budget is likely to get better results (more “bang for the buck”) with expert guidance in planning.
