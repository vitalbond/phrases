<div>The sale dates have been announced! Mark your calendar, it starts March 1, 2013 and will run for about six weeks.<br><br>Each sale is a little different but the data we have on this upcoming sale is as follows:<br><br><br><div class="p1">If your total purchase is $3,500.00 (including kitchen cabinets, appliances, counter tops, interior fittings), you can get a 15% discount. If your total purchase is $4,500 you can get a 20% discount.</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">How does this work out? An average kitchen requires 18 cabinets total, top and bottom. The cost of your cabinets will vary (a lot) with the door style you choose. But most kitchen purchases will easily top $3,500-$4,500. So by ordering during the sale period you can save $500-$900 or more. </div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">We show our clients how to best take advantage of the sale discounts. The methods vary with the type of project. For example, sometimes buying something you don't need can boost your sale discount. That is to say, for example, can save $500 by buying a $200 item. You can then sell the item and come out way ahead. </div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">It's time to get started on the planning and design phase.  First, get our free eBook, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=%22http://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/r7x2q5/%22%3EFill%20out%20my%20form!%3C/a%3E" target="_blank">How to Budget for an IKEA Kitchen Remodel</a>. This will help you know what the real costs are, both labor and materials. </div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">The next step is to plan the layout. That's what we do, so contact us if you would like help (We offer a free, no-obligation 30-minute consultation). But the layout plan is vital for the next step, which is getting labor bids. A contractor needs to know what the cabinet placement will be in order to give you a comprehensive, and thus accurate, bid. </div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">The sale, running for six weeks, really is the best time to order, but only if you can either launch the project during or right after delivery (usually 1-2 weeks after ordering) or if you have a storage place that is dry. Timing is part of the planning.</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Keep in mind that during sales, all IKEA kitchen departments and even all IKEA kitchen pros, get very busy. The best time to order is early in the sale, when stocks are high, wait times are minimal, and you can schedule to suit your own preferences, rather than having to wait for a contractor or installer. </div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1">Ready, set.....</div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="p1"><br></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Remodeling Budget Guide on Kindle
