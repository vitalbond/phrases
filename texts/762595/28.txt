<div><br><div class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA cabinet frames (the box, not including the doors or drawer fronts) are made of medium-density fiberboard (MDF). This is an engineered wood product formed by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibers which are mixed with wax and a resin binder, and formed into panels by applying high temperature and pressure. </span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">When people say they prefer wood cabinets, they mean plywood because that is what is used in contemporary “wood frame” cabinets., and is less likely to warp. </span><span class="s2">Although plywood cabinets may seem more desirable than particle board cabinets, consider that </span><span class="s1">MDF is denser than plywood and that </span><span class="s2">plywood warps more easily over time. MDF, made from wood chips, is also a more eco-friendly, sustainable product.  </span><span class="s1"></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"></span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">Sustainability relates to durability, too. IKEA cabinets come with an unbeatable 25 year warranty which suggests that they expect your new cabinets to last that long. Most kitchen cabinetry on the market, including custom and semi-custom, have 1/4" to 5/8" MDF frames. IKEA kitchen cabinets have 3/4" frames and are thus sturdier, and likely to last longer.</span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">Most non-custom cabinet frames available today have similar MDF or particle board substrates covered by either melamine, laminate, or wood veneer.  In the US, only custom cabinet makers use solid plywood for their frames.  Cabinets imported from China may have wood boxes but the shipping cost and timeframes, labor practices and toxicity of glues and stains makes them a poor choice in most cases. </span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">IKEA cabinet frames come in either a white or beech-colored plastic laminate surface.  These interiors are not elegant, but you get the same type and quality in most kitchen cabinets, including much more expensive Kraft Maid frames.  Keep in mind that in a well-designed and installed IKEA kitchen, you don’t see the frames so their elegance is not an issue. Still, you will probably want to choose the white frames when using white or light colored doors, and the birch for darker exteriors. If you are using glass doors and/or inside cabinet lights, your decision about interiors is more vital.</span></div><div class="p3"><br><span class="s1"></span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">Chemically sensitive homeowners might research the subject of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and formaldehyde, two common components of the glues and binders used in MDF. If you’ve bought new carpet or a mattress or a couch, you know that the odor of these new products can remain for months or years. This is called “off-gassing” and IKEA stands out from the pack when it comes to their standards.  Since 1986, IKEA has applied the German formaldehyde and VOC requirements, currently the strictest, even where no limit exists. They state that the German limit is such that even persons who are over sensitive to formaldehyde should not experience any problems. IKEA tests its products for off-gassing, according to this from IKEA Corporate Communications in the US:</span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s3">Both the total product and every single part of a <a href="http://www.ikeafans.com/forums/autolink.php?id=129&forumid=254&script=showthread"><span class="s4">IKEA products</span></a> has to </span><span class="s1">fulfill the emission requirement (including different materials like melamine and both the inside and outside of a product). This involves limit values both for short term (after unpacking a product; measurements after 5, 24 and 48 hours) and long term (check </span>point after 28 days).”</div><div class="p7"><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">Sustainability relates to durability, too. IKEA cabinets come with an unbeatable 25 year warranty which suggests that they expect your new cabinets to last that long. </span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">The appearance and durability of a completed IKEA kitchen can vary with the skill and know-how of the installer. For the handy, an IKEA kitchen can be a do-it-yourself project, but carefully building the frames, and mounting the hardware correctly is a big factor in durability and appearance. </span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">IKEA kitchen cabinet hardware is surprisingly good quality. The drawer glides, hinges, dampers, and legs are all well-made and durable, comparable to hardware found on cabinets costing three or four times the price. IKEA handles and knobs are a great value as well. </span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">The doors and drawer fronts are the parts of the cabinet that you actually see and that create the look of the kitchen. Unlike the frames, many of the doors and drawers options are solid wood or good quality wood veneer.  IKEA offers a good variety and in many price points from inexpensive laminates to higher priced oak.  They also offer glass door options and lacquered doors in fashionable colors to use as accent pieces. </span></div><div class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></div><div class="p4"><span class="s1">Overall the variety and quality of IKEA components make them unbeatable for the price. </span></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Remodeling Budget Guide on Kindle
