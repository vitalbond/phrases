JUNE 28 THROUGH AUGUST 25, 2013.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Let's be logical. IKEA cabinets are high value, affordable, beautiful, cabinets and as sustainable a product as any other kitchen cabinet out there. If you are thrifty, you plan out your project (which should include, in almost every case, getting the help of a professional kitchen designer to optimize the layout of cabinets), and you await the next IKEA kitchen sale.<br><br>These happen predictably in fall and spring. These bi-annual sales last six weeks or more. You can pretty much plan your project around them. The discount structure can vary. It can be based on total purchase amount (e.g., if you buy over $3500 in kitchen merchandise you get a 15% discount on the total purchase). Or it can be based on the number of IKEA (Whirlpool Gold) appliances you buy (e.g., one appliance 10% discount, two appliances 15%, three appliances 20%). Use of an IKEA credit card can also, sometimes, get you a discount or other value. <br><br>But the summer sale is less predictable. As of this date, June 25, 2013, I have heard several reports of different summer sale start dates. It's frustrating but it's optimistic. There is likely to be a sale soon.<br><br>One store person told me that the sale will start when they mail their new 2013-2014 catalog, late July.<br><br>My suggestion if you are waiting for a sale, is to finalize your kitchen layout (we do expert, elegant IKEA kitchen design and provide project support), get labor bids and choose a contractor, shop around for lighting fixtures, sinks, faucets, flooring, tile, appliances and/or any other materials you won't be buying at IKEA. Read my IKEA kitchen project budgeting guide (Click here to request it: <a href="https://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/r7x2q5/" target="_blank">free IKEA kitchen budgeting eBook).</a><br><br>In other words, take the time to organize your project and your thoughts. Work out how you'll deal with a torn-apart kitchen for a few weeks. Work out how to keep remodeling dust out of other rooms. Make a space in your garage or living room for the cabinet delivery (several dozen very heavy flat boxes).<br><br><br><br>Much love,<br>Susan<div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
