I am sure it's harmless and might have some real benefits attached to it.<br><br>The one thing I have heard from clients in the last two months is that if you are an IKEA Family member, you can buy an IKEA kitchen up to 90 days BEFORE a sale starts and, when the sale does start, bring your receipt in and get refunded the discount you would have gotten if you had ordered during the sale.<br><br>If you use this tip, make sure to absolutely verify it before you order, in YOUR local IKEA. This might only be true for some areas, only in the US, only in Canada, etc. So VERIFY. <br><br>You see, I don't want to spread false data, or even a rumor, BUT this is too good not to tell you about. I think of all the clients we have that wait for months, even when it would be more convenient not to wait, to save 20% (which is totally logical because 20% of a kitchen purchase is a big chunk of dough usually, pardon the cooking metaphor).'<br><br>Example: Sale starts March 1. You go into IKEA (with an elegant, optimal design plus complete order list, which my company has created for you....:))&nbsp; on January 15. The cabinets plus counter top plus two appliances costs you $6000. Your contractor starts the project January 21 and it's done February 12. Bring the IKEA receipt back to the store March 2 and get refunded $1200.<br><br>Beautiful!<br><br>Here are other ways I am happy to help you: <br><br><br><a href="http://mfkp.wufoo.com/forms/r7x2q5/" target="_blank">Request my free eBook</a>, How to Budget for an IKEA Kitchen Remodel<br><br><div><br></div><div><a href="https://www.timetrade.com/book/T4DNM" target="_blank">FREE 30-minute IKEA kitchen planning consultation</a></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Design and Remodeling Tips </div></div>
