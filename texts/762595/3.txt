According to my sources, the American Kitchen and Bath Association says that the average kitchen remodel in the U.S. costs $47,000...!<br /><br /><div style="color: #b45f06;"><i>Are they using cabinets made of solid gold?</i></div><br />Our company regularly completes beautiful kitchen remodels that cost the homeowner $10,000. When a customer chooses a <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">countertop</span> material such as <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Corian</span> or <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Caesarstone</span>, their costs can go up to $20,000, including some extras such as cabinet lighting, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">tilework</span>, flooring.<br /><br />I really don't know where this $47,000 figure comes from. I cannot figure out how, using <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">IKEA</span> cabinets you could, if you wanted to, spend $47,000. Gold faucets? Marble counters shipped from Italy? A 2000 square foot kitchen?<br /><br />Sad to say, we know that homeowners are spending MORE than $47,000 on kitchen remodels and never realizing that there are other ways, other materials, without compromising quality, durability, or beauty, that are available to them.  Maybe it's a status thing?<br /><br />We always hope to have a chance to point out the type of amazing results that can be attained for a much lower cost. Many customers have already decided on <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">IKEA</span> cabinets when they contact us. We provide professional design so that the kitchen, once installed,  serves their needs and pleases them aesthetically, and is optimally laid out for function and enjoyment. This is truly a vital part of the process.<br /><br />It may be that people assume <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">IKEA</span> cabinets will be comparable in quality to some of their other furnishings. This is understandable. It is not factual though. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">IKEA</span> cabinets are, in fact, higher quality, and carry better <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">warranties</span>, than some brands that cost three times as much.<br /><br />It is true that if you go to a "big box" store, you'll get design help on the spot. This can be comforting but it comes at a very big price. You will almost never have the option of European styling, and, more to the point, your final price is almost inevitably going to be at least twice what you would pay for <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">IKEA</span> cabinets plus installation. Those big box stores, once they've sold you on their cabinets, assume you will want their installers and you will probably feel they are most qualified. If you go this route, make sure you meet your installer before signing up for his service. Don't assume the big box store is guaranteeing his accountability.<br /><br />Going the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">IKEA</span> route, it initially seems that you have to do the design yourself, which makes most people nervous right from the start. Or you have to locate a designer. There are only a few people in the LA area, and likely in any area, truly qualified to design <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">IKEA</span> kitchens. It is a unique system, not like any other, and knowing the products is vital. A kitchen designer who has limited <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">IKEA</span> experience is not the best choice. If you are in LA, give me a call, 626-203-1480, and I can provide more on this point or schedule our $375 planning service for you. It's the best planning service I know of. We ensure you have a great layout, an expert contractor to consult with, and that you have labor and materials costs known before you get started. We've developed this service over years of experience and discovery of what homeowners really need help with in order to confidently move forward. We really want people to be thrilled with their new kitchens. If you have $3000 or $30,000 to spend, treat yourself to professional design. As they say, you'll be glad you did. It is certainly worth $375, no matter your budget. <span style="font-style: italic;">In fact, doing it right the first time is one of the best ways to save money.</span><br /><br />This post is meant to simply confirm what most readers already know. <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">IKEA</span> cabinets are very high quality and cost much less than big box and name brands of other types. In any economy and no matter the reason, "<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">Kabinet</span> King"-type companies are NOT recommended. Call to discuss my view on these.<br /><br />Installation, if the planning is done well, can be very affordable also. Your choices determine your costs to a very great extent.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that you can spend $5000 and have a brand new, modest, small or condo kitchen. You can have a fabulous 10 x 15 kitchen completed for under $20,000. We do this all the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Susan<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Spend a little of even a tight budget on design help. Ensuring you have an optimal layout will save you money in the long run, both in purchasing and installing the cabinets. If you can't find a local designer, call us, we can work via email and phone, 626-203-1480.&nbsp;<div class="blogger-post-footer">IKEA Kitchen Remodeling Budget Guide on Kindle
