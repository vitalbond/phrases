I've written before about IKEA kitchen sales but I wanted to make sure my friends and readers know that, as March looms ahead, we can look forward to another sale. I know there are many of you who have been saving and/or planning your remodel and eagerly awaiting this upcoming sale.<br /><br />We moved recently and in our new city we continue to work with our L.A. area designer. I would really like to compile a list of IKEA-expert designers and contractors in the U.S. who have proven to be true IKEA kitchen professionals so PLEASE write me if you know of one. I will share the data with others.<br /><br />Insofar as design, make sure you do enlist the help of an expert kitchen designer who is highly experienced with IKEA cabinets. I cannot overstate the importance of this. Even if you have tight budget, or a tiny kitchen, spend a few bucks on design help. It is simply the best way.<br /><br />Buy plastic bowls or bookshelves at IKEA any time. But to remodel a kitchen you need a designer.<br />You are going to spend thousands of dollars on materials, you are going to tear your home apart, you are going to be dealing with gas, electrical, water lines, plumbing, lighting, codes and permits. Do get expert help with the layout. You will be VERY glad.<br /><br />During sale periods at IKEA, the sooner you order, the better. As the sale moves toward an end, the lines get longer, the waits longer, the sales staff more harried, the delivery service slower, etc. I would suggest getting the design underway A MONTH before you order, if you can.<br /><br />Any designer will ensure your measurements are done right and are complete (although you can have IKEA do measurements in some cities), and will then provide design work that will likely surprise you with ideas you have not considered (first, because the IKEA software does not allow you to do many things, and second because a professional designer just has ideas and experience us non-experts don't!). You can then take a bit of time to consider options, revise, and finalize. You will really understand what it is you are buying when you work with an expert and when you go to the store, you'll have a complete list, even when customized parts are involved. It is SO MUCH easier.<br /><br />We have had customers call to say that when they went to order, especially during a sale, they breezed through the process while they saw others sitting at those IKEA computer terminals (maybe not DOS but surely Windows 98-ish) sweating with frustration.<br /><br />Avoid this trauma but, even more important, ensure your kitchen design is truly optimal. Call or write me and I am happy to provide design referrals and any resources I have for your area.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26063766-5428937513303688072?l=ikeakitchenhelp.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
