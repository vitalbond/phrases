<p><strong>&nbsp;How It Works:</strong></p>
<p>FreshRealm connects Shoppers &amp; Merchants to a national network of Food Suppliers, Food Makers and Food Packers.</p>
<p>The existing network has facilities across the countries that have been supplying established institutions with fresh, prepared food for over 10 years.</p>
<p>By organizing and streamlining existing systems, data, and markets, they aim to bring fresh food to everyone while eliminating the spoilage and false demand that contribute to catastrophic food waste.</p>
<p>FreshRealm now allows everyone to benefit from decades of product development, food sourcing, food preparation and food safety expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Best Part Is:</strong></p>
<p>FreshRealm has also developed a Co-Drop network to allow people to group orders in a Vessel. The applications of this are wide and significant. People can get food delivered to wherever they are already planning on being.</p>
