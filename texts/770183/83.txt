<div><p>Every startup with any traction quickly reaches a point where they need to hire employees to grow the business. Unfortunately, this always happens when pressures are the highest, and business processes are ill-defined. At this point you need superstars and versatile future executives, yet your in-house hiring processes and focus are at their weakest.</p>
<p>The result is a host of hiring mistakes that sink many young companies, or take years to fix. The solution is to never forget that hiring is a top priority task for the CEO, which should never be delegated, and which often has to supersede the urgent crises of the day.</p>
<p>A key success element is to start by avoiding the known list of interviewing and hiring mistakes that have been documented many times by human resources professionals. Here&rsquo;s a tongue-in-cheek summary of ten big ones to jog your recollection:</p>
<p><a href="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hiring-mistakes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35601" title="hiring mistakes" src="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hiring-mistakes.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="99"></a></p>
<ol><li><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure what we need, but this guy sounds like a miracle worker.&rdquo; </strong>The message here is that if you don&rsquo;t know exactly what help you need, you probably won&rsquo;t get it. Do your homework on a proper job description, and make sure the applicant credentials on the resume are a fit before you proceed to interview.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not quite what I&rsquo;m looking for, but I think he is trainable.&rdquo; </strong>This is the inverse of the first problem &ndash; you know what you want, but you are trying to force fit the candidate into the position. Maybe you are desperate to fill the position, or he&rsquo;s related to the boss.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident this candidate can learn a lot from me.&rdquo; </strong>This is the arrogant position that you know more than anyone you could hire, so all you need is a helper, not help. Helpers are expensive, since it often takes longer to jointly do a job than it would take one qualified person to do it alone.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have time to read the resume, but he has great answers.&rdquo; </strong>Some people talk a good story, but can&rsquo;t produce results. Resumes won&rsquo;t give you the positive conclusion, but they can highlight negatives, like job gaps, bad writing, and minimal experience.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t keep up with me on results, but we have to start somewhere.&rdquo;</strong>It&rsquo;s always a mistake to judge a candidate by using yourself as the bar. You should assume that you are looking for someone who has skills you don&rsquo;t have.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;This one is such a good fit that I don&rsquo;t need to waste time on a second interview.&rdquo; </strong>No matter how good you are, we can all miss things the first time around. Never hire someone without a second interview, and without having a second interviewer verify your assessment. Everyone you hire has to fit effectively with many others on the team.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;After my sales pitch, he was so excited I knew he could do the job.&rdquo; </strong>Some hiring managers spend the interview selling the company under some mistaken impression that the level of candidate excitement they can generate is indicative of future performance.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not perfect, but our only alternative is to let the work stack up even more.&rdquo; </strong>This is pure desperation, guaranteed to have bad results. If you hire someone who can&rsquo;t do the job, the work backs up more, and your work doubles to get them replaced.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;His experience is light, but he seems like a good guy.&rdquo; </strong>Avoid evaluating just personality in lieu of job skills. All the statistical research shows that there is very little correlation between a good personality and any specific job. Look for job knowledge first.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Based on the glowing terms I heard from my friend, I&rsquo;ll just skip the reference check.&rdquo; </strong>There are lots of factors that can&rsquo;t be assessed in an interview, or by listening only to an advocate. In this litigious society, reference checks are more productive if you also listen to what is not said.</li>
</ol><p>Another element is admitting that there are things you don&rsquo;t know, and identifying what they are. Too many executives let their ego stand in the way, either in admitting that there might be things they don&rsquo;t do well, or in identifying and communicating specific job requirements.</p>
<p>Take a lesson from an old Business Week article by entrepreneur Andy Dunn, aptly named &ldquo;<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/dec2009/sb20091224_646669.htm">To Recruit the Best, Admit Weaknesses</a>&rdquo; where he admitted to the best applicants &ldquo;I am not good at what you do, I need your help.&rdquo; In my view, if every CEO and hiring manager followed this advice, as well as good hiring practices, their business would scale a lot faster with a lot less headaches.</p>
