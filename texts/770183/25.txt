<p><a href="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/organize-gifts.jpg"><img title="organize gifts" alt="" src="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/organize-gifts.jpg" width="122" height="79"></a>Slice now lets you send customized emails to anyone you&rsquo;ve bought a gift for online, so you can let them know that a package is headed their way and when it&rsquo;s scheduled to arrive, without giving away the contents of the delivery.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<p>When you shop online, merchants send you order confirmation emails (receipts) and shipping notification emails with tracking numbers.</p>
<p>Slice automatically processes these shopping emails that are delivered to your email inbox, and allows you to easily access your purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Cute Feature:</strong></p>
<p>Slice&rsquo;s Track With Friends feature allows online shoppers to personalize their email notifications with custom gift-wrapping to reflect the holidays and personal messages while including practical information such as tracking numbers and optional product details.</p>
