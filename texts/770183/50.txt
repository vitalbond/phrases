<p>Giift.com is &nbsp;the world&rsquo;s largest<a href="http://visionwiz.net/2011/07/reward-your-loyal-fans-through-voxbloc/"> loyalty and card network</a>, including mileage programs, loyalty programs, memberships, vouchers, coupons, prepaid cards and gift cards.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
<p>All you need to do is just sign in by providing a username, email address and password, or by using your Facebook or Google+ account;</p>
<p>Then add all of your existing<a href="http://visionwiz.net/2010/12/give-reward-to-your-visitors-automatically-for-any-specific-actionregistration-upgrade-newsletter/"> loyalty programs</a>, mileage programs, gift cards and membership cards into your portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loyalty-programs.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35445" title="loyalty programs" src="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loyalty-programs.png" alt="" width="117" height="39"></a></p>
<p>By adding your programs and cards to your Giift.com portfolio, you will be able to manage and track all your loyalty programs and prepaid/gift cards online (the same way you manage and track your personal bank account online).</p>
<p>You will also know more about what you actually own (details of the program or the card, expiration, redemption mechanism&hellip;).</p>
<p>In addition, from your portfolio, you will have direct access to best deals in just once click.</p>
<p>If, however, you are not interested in redeeming the programs or cards you own, you will be able to trade them, either for cash or for another program or card, depending on &ldquo;offer and demand&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You will see that all the programs and cards you own have more dollar value and more ways to be used than you thought.</p>
<p>Now invite your friends, look at the best promotions and deals they have found for you, sell or exchange the programs and cards you don&rsquo;t intend to redeem.</p>
