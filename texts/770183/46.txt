<p>Shopkick works directly with retailers to provide in-store rewards for certain actions like walking in the door or scanning a bar code.</p>
<p>Its not rewarding users with virtual goods or contextual information like user reviews, instead it directly offer kickbacks, discounts, and real-world incentives for customers.</p>
<p>The idea is that everything you do earns you points, or &ldquo;kickbucks,&rdquo; which can be redeemed for anything from Facebook Credits to gift cards. Check in to a store and get a couple of points; physically walk in and get even more points. Scan the barcodes of certain items and the points roll in. As you go, the app begins suggesting deals and offering discounts.</p>
<p>Shopkick has partnered with Macy&rsquo;s, Best Buy, Sports Authority, American Eagle Outfitters and the Simon Property Group (an operator of malls across the country).</p>
