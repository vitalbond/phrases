<div><p>Most aspiring entrepreneurs are convinced that the strength of their initial idea somehow defines them as a leader, as well as the success potential of their derivative business. In my experience, it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated than that. It takes leadership ability, as well as a good idea, to make a successful entrepreneur, and great leaders evolve from key leadership decisions along the way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, basic leadership and entrepreneurial skills can be acquired from experience and training. If you don&rsquo;t have the entrepreneur leadership attribute or interest, but want to be an &ldquo;idea person&rdquo; or inventor, then I recommend that you find a partner with the requisite skills to implement and run the business from your idea.</p>
<p>Yet we all know that there is a big gap between good entrepreneurs and a great business leaders. Great leaders seem to make the right pivotal decisions at every critical point along the way. I&rsquo;ve never been able to clearly define those key points, and what separates the good from the great at these points.</p>
<p>So I was happy to see Julia Tang Peters, in her new book &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pivot-Points-Decisions-Successful-Leader/dp/1118894731" target="_blank">Pivot Points</a>,&rdquo; tackle this issue. She concludes from her work with many modern business leaders, including CEOs Bud Frankel (Frankel &amp; Company) and Glen Tullman (7wire Ventures), that there are five pivotal decisions that propel certain entrepreneurs to be gifted leaders:</p>
<p><a href="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Gifted-Leaders.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35596" title="Gifted Leaders" src="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Gifted-Leaders.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="112"></a></p>
<ol><li><strong>The</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>launching</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>decision.</strong> At some point an idea captures your imagination and creating a business becomes more than just about income. You define goals that rivet your attention, galvanizing you to turn dreams into reality. The launching point establishes the platform on which every potential entrepreneur becomes an actualized entrepreneur.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>turning point</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>decision.</strong> This is the confluence of your willful decision to do more, and the pressing need to take action. It unleashes an extraordinary verve to take the idea or business to the next level. It tests your capabilities and capacity in various ways, stretching them far beyond your comfort zone and requiring total commitment.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>tipping point</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>decision.</strong> Here you are catapulted into leading and working&nbsp;<em>on the business</em>, as distinctly different from the work of mastering your subject and<em>working in the business</em>. At this point you will have built a team whom you trust with substantive responsibilities, freeing you to hone the art of leading, inside and outside the business.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>recommitment</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>decision</strong>. Now is the time when you as the leader look at where you are and where you want to go, knowing the need to renew the commitment or leave. For many this happens during disruptive change, like being acquired or being the acquirer. For others, it&rsquo;s a personal decision to balance family life, or do something different.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong><strong> </strong><strong><em>letting go</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong>decision. </strong><strong> </strong>The ultimate test of leadership is letting go at a time of strength so that others can carry on the work. It may be a hold&rsquo;em or fold&rsquo;em business situation, or simply time to plan for succession. This decision point is the most emotionally challenging, since letting go is pivotal in defining the terms of the entrepreneur&rsquo;s legacy.</li>
</ol><p>I&rsquo;m certain that an understanding of these points will equip you with the knowledge you need to take the right path on decisions when it matters most. The world is full of high-achievers and high expectations, but without the proper framework for turning entrepreneurial determination into real leadership accomplishment, you risk going nowhere.</p>
<p>I agree with Peters that entrepreneurial leadership is not all about people traits or characteristics, but often about the choices they make at key decision points along the way. Of course, skills in decision-making are not enough alone to make a great entrepreneurial leader. Here are some of the other characteristics I look for:</p>
<ul><li>Willing to listen, and will      address skeptical views.</li>
<li>Always an evangelist and a good      communicator.</li>
<li>Willing to question assumptions      and adapt.</li>
<li>Proactively sets metrics and      track goals.</li>
<li>Ties rewards to performance      results.</li>
<li>Aggressively takes smart risks.</li>
</ul><p>So a great idea is necessary but not sufficient to make you a great entrepreneur and a great leader. Work on the right characteristics, and think hard about those five key pivotal decisions that can make or break your satisfaction and your legacy. It&rsquo;s more fun when you are the entrepreneur leader&nbsp;<em>you</em> want to be.</p>
