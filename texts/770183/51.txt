<div><p><strong>212th 1M/1M Roundtable: Series A Pitch Needs Clarity On Hard Numbers</strong></p>
<p>During this week&rsquo;s roundtable we listened to four presentations. The first two entrepreneurs are a part of the Startup Palm Beach meetup, the others are from our general community.</p>
<p><strong>Krowde</strong></p>
<p>First up, Daniel Gudema from Boca Raton, Florida, pitched Krowde, a mobile social network for small businesses to manage their communities. In the roadmap is a web version as well. It&rsquo;s an interesting and useful concept that is looking to get to the next level with some additional financing.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.play2shop.com/index.html">Play2Shop</a></strong></p>
<p>Next, John Benton from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pitched Play2Shop, a cross-breed between eBates and Gaming, whereby, casual gaming is used to engage an audience that collects points and then redeems through e-commerce.</p>
<p><a href="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/One-million-entrepreneur.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35454" title="One-million-entrepreneur" src="http://visionwiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/One-million-entrepreneur.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="151"></a></p>
<p>The company has started validating its multiple assumptions: monetization model, customer acquisition strategy, etc., using a seed funding it has raised already. Now, approaching the need for a Series A, it needs to get clarity on customer acquisition cost and the hard numbers driving this business.</p>
<p><strong>HTxA</strong></p>
<p>Also, Ralf Lippold from Dresden, Germany, pitched HTxA, a social media marketing service for conference organizers. The concept is pretty straightforward. The entrepreneur needs some training on how to build such a business, which is plenty viable.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.blabberpad.com/">Blabberpad</a></strong></p>
<p>Then, Suraj Panjabi from Mumbai, India, pitched Blabberpad, a voice-oriented social media platform that the team has spent 2.5 years developing. At this point, the company is out of cash, and is looking for an acquirer. While I am not bullish about the prospects of acqui-hiring in India, if one of the readers is interested, please feel free to contact Suraj.</p>
