<div><p>Happy New Year! It&rsquo;s great to kick off 2014 with awesome videos of the YUIConf 2013 presentations. If you recall from <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2012/12/03/yuiconf-2012-talk-anthony-pipkin-on-building-modules-for-the-new-gallery/">last year</a>, we posted a new video every few days or so for you to check out. We are kicking off this series with a great talk from Eric Ferraiuolo on &ldquo;<a href="http://youtu.be/0qN3mHH5snc">YUI and the Future</a>&ldquo;. Stay tuned! In a few days we&rsquo;ll have another new presentation to share.</p>
