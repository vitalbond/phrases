<div><p>Thank you to everyone who submitted a talk proposal for <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/"><strong>YUIConf</strong></a> this year! We&rsquo;re excited to bring in some fresh ideas to make this the best year ever, but as always the quality of the tech talks will be the highest priority.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul><li>Event gestures, mobile apps, testing, performance</li>
<li>Case studies from Yahoo Search, Yahoo Mail, and Yahoo Sports</li>
<li>Back by popular demand, a sequel to <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2012/12/10/yuiconf-2012-talk-writing-for-developers-some-rational-techniques-by-evan-goer/">last year&rsquo;s talk</a> by Evan Goer</li>
<li>Keynotes by Eric Ferraiuolo, Ariya Hidayat, and Dav Glass</li>
<li>And much, much more!</li>
</ul><p>Take advantage of this opportunity to meet the YUI team as well as fellow community members. It&rsquo;s an excellent time to get a glimpse of the future as well as look back on the progress we&rsquo;ve made over the past year in features, performance, and stability.</p>
