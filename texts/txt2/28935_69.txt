<div><p><em>Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community.</em></p>
<h2 id="release-news">Release News</h2>
<p>Work has started on <a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule">Sprint 12</a>, which will culminate in a YUI Release on February 25th. That&rsquo;s only three short weeks away!</p>
<h2 id="open-roundtable">Open Roundtable</h2>
<p>In this week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXcbJ-U_WDU">Open Roundtable</a>, Alberto and Clarence introduced us to Modown. We talked about design goals, how to incorporate <a href="https://npmjs.org/search?q=modown">Modown</a> into a project, and discussed a few of the components in greater detail. If you&rsquo;re interested in NodeJS and build Express applications, you should check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXcbJ-U_WDU">the video on Youtube</a>. Modown consists of components that are useful in small and large apps.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-news">YUI in the news</h2>
<p>Our CI guru, <a href="https://twitter.com/reid">Reid Burke</a> wrote a comprehensive post over at <a href="http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/75054690857/code-coverage-for-executable-node-js-scripts">Yahoo&rsquo;s Engineering Tumblr</a> this week. He discussed the issues around gathering code coverage metrics for executable scripts in NodeJS. To address this problem, he released an npm package called <a href="https://github.com/reid/mock-utf8-stream"><code>mock-utf8-stream</code></a>, which makes it easy to run tests on streams. All in a week&rsquo;s work!</p>
