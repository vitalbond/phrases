<div><p>Testing your code is one of the best things you can do for the quality of your app. For a project as large as YUI this can present a number of challenges. <a href="https://twitter.com/reid">Reid Burke</a> in his YUIConf presentation &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AABmn_h4HAM">Testing YUI Everywhere</a>&rdquo; talks about the issues he faces daily in keeping our CI system up and healthy. You&rsquo;ll definitely find some great insights into how we test our code and get a glimpse of the work he&rsquo;s been doing. You can find the previous YUIConf talk <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2014/02/28/yuiconf-2013-evan-goer-on-thinking-of-documentation-as-code/">here</a>, and watch all of them <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKP9DUCzZorde6sLWHJ3GNd-6VrGrbqm">via YouTube</a>.</p>
