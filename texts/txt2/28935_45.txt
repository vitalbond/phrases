<div><p>Last year the &ldquo;Lightning Talks&rdquo; session at YUIConf 2012 was one of the more popular segments of the conference. We want to give this year&rsquo;s YUIConf attendees an opportunity give an informal 5-10 minute talk. It can be anything from discussing a site you created using YUI, to a Gallery component you published, or just about anything YUI or even front-end related. This is very informal and can be a great opportunity to get your feet wet in giving presentations.</p>
