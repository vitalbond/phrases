<p>This week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9BQta07N_A">Open Roundtable</a> featured another episode of <em>YUI In The Wild</em>. This week, <a href="https://twitter.com/tivac">Pat Cavit</a> from <a href="http://www.arena.net/">ArenaNet</a> joined us to talk about how they use YUI for their <a href="http://www.guildwars2.com/">websites</a> and in-game user-interfaces.</p>
<p>Pat touched on a bunch of tools that are used in ArenaNet, such a NodeJS-powered task runner called <a href="http://github.com/tivac/dullard">Dullard</a>, and a YUI meta-data extractor called <a href="https://github.com/tivac/yui-configger">Configgur</a>. He also showed a bunch of modules and <a href="https://github.com/tivac/yui-viewparent">extensions</a> on top of YUI. Check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9BQta07N_A">entire video</a> and browse <a href="http://github.com/tivac/">Pat&rsquo;s GitHub</a> to find the repositories that was referenced.</p>
