After opening to a humongous 32.92 Crores and grossing 14.55 Crores on it’s 2nd Day, Ek Tha Tiger looks pretty steady with 59.22 Crores in it’s pocket," reports Koimoi.com.</span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> Salman The movie might have seen a steady fall in its last two days but one can surely account that to working days not being huge grossing days. However, Ek Tha Tiger has created a new record at the Indian Box Office. In its 1st weekend (i.e. 1st 3 days run) it has grossed about 59 crores which is the highest ever in Indian history. Post Monday, when the fasting season of Ramadan gets over, there is no saying what collections will the movie make," adds the website.</span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> "After shattering every record possible to shreds Ek Tha Tiger moved to its 2nd day. As per early estimates the movie would have made 16 crores on it’s Day 2 at the Indian Box Office. Ek Tha Tiger had grossed a humongous 32.92 crores on its Day 1 and its total box office collections till date stands at 48.92 crores," reported Koimoi.com. </span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> "The fall was quite expected as Thursday was a working day and not a holiday unlike Wednesday. However, the movie is expected to hit the chords again this weekend. There is no doubt that Ek Tha Tiger will prove to be an all time blockbuster at the box office if it sustains its momentum even for a weekend," added the website. </span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> So what you want to say about Ek Tha Tiger first week collection and Ek Tha Tiger 5 day collection.Do you think Ek tha tiger deserve 100 crore.come up with your comment.</span></h3></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7248443983482233190-7765434613463663756?l=www.youthface.in" alt=""></div></div>
