He has a knack of choosing the right kind of new talent. We are thinking of her but nothing is finalised yet,".  "The third part will have four main players it could be two heroes, two heroines or three heroes and one heroine. We haven't thought of the exact number of actors and actress yet. We might repeat one of the male actors from 'Jism 2'," she said.</span><br><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;">Jism 3 will release in  April and during winter 2013.Pooja bhatt also sid that they will come with jism 4. </span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> "Then we would go ahead with 'Jism 4' in 2014. It is just a coincidence that the year, ending with 3 (2013) will have 'Jism 3' and 4 (2014) will have 'Jism 4'. I don?t know how far we will take the 'Jism' franchise. I have not planned it yet," Pooja said. </span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> When Pooja was asked about jism 2 then she said that  "I was anxious. The film had no big star cast, we did not have Salman Khan in the film but it did quite well at the box office. I was taking a bigger risk by having Sunny in my film putting her in front of a conservative crowd here. People thought with Sunny in the film, they will get to see more of sexual and sensual content but that was a myth," </span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> "The film has earned Rs 21 crore, I think we have got a great opening. Generally filmmakers do not release their movies during Ramzan as not many people go to watch it. But this film has done well especially in places like UP, Bhopal, Punjab and others. It worked for us,"</span></h3><h3><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"> What do you want to say about sunny leone in Bollywood whether sunny leone porn films or sunny leone bollywood films and Nathalia Kaur likely to replace Sunny Leone in Jism 3 come with your comment.</span></h3></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7248443983482233190-2538605706021689661?l=www.youthface.in" alt=""></div></div>
