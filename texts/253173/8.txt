His commitment to what he does exhaust and spoils you. But it’s good exhaustion and a good spoiling. You start looking for the same calibre of commitment in others. And that’s dangerous. What Aamir is done to ensure his hundred percent concentration to Satyamev Jayate is exceptional. Do you know, he didn’t take up a single commitment while he shot for the show? He didn’t even shoot for an ad! He postponed the release of his next film for our show. Which other star would do that? And without that level of commitment another Satyamev Jayate is not possible. It can’t be done with the star taking a few hours off from shooting to record episodes,”&nbsp;</span></span></h3><h3> <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;2.When asked from uday that is there is&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">lack of connectivity  between Aamir and victims&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">then he said that “It is actually a problem from the other end. The people who come on the show with their problems are so awestuck by Aamir’s presence that they begin to posture and grow completely selfconscious in their&nbsp;behavior. You’ve no idea how much effort Aamir makes to get the interviewees comfortable in his presence before the camera rolls. Unfortunately they are just too overwhelmed by his presence. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. I don’t know how.”</span></span></h3><h3> <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small; font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;3.Uday when asked that what he want to say about Aamir and this show “Look, it isn’t as if we haven’t done&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">socially relevant shows on Star Plus&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">earlier. But Aamir doing it took our battle to take&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">television entertainment&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">to another level, to a peak we had never imagined. Let’s be honest. The last ten years of television’s life has brought it to saturation point. The soaps, the game shows, reality shows…have all had their innings. The&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">television viewing demography</span><span style="background-color: white;">had reached a state of stagnancy.
