During the days of king, they associated a king's convoy to help them repair their carts. But due to industrialization, conventional careers became non-existent for them.</span></span><br><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kP4MR4AS_qU/UePlNaTQgJI/AAAAAAAACaM/ncKrWP0-w64/s1600/7150_471050992974507_764295106_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="The Idea Caravan,Giving a voice to denotified tribes in India,Issue of Denotified Tribes in Independent India,Denotified Tribes in gujrat,help Denotified Tribes " border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kP4MR4AS_qU/UePlNaTQgJI/AAAAAAAACaM/ncKrWP0-w64/s320/7150_471050992974507_764295106_n.jpg" width="320"></a></span></span></div><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;">Living in unsafe circumstances, India&rsquo;s denotified and nomadic areas are topic to maltreatment and misuse by all and varied.Now this community exist but they don't have any right they are living in their own country like a slaves. But some people in our country still think about them, These are the people who don't run behind name and fame but behind emotions.Emotions to build new India and out of those is Mittal Patel ,being a lady taking&nbsp; up the cause of nomadic tribes and getting them an identity of their own.</span></span><br><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;">Even after 62 years of freedom, a large area of the nation's denotified areas (DNTs) and areas keep stay out of the demographics list, as they are not authorized as main citizens. The last community-wise demographics of these areas was done during the colonial rule in 1931.</span></span><br><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;">More than four million nomads live in Gujarat and roughly 60 million&nbsp; are available in the nation. It was surprising to discover there was no details or details available on them even in the gov divisions. Though the govt understands of certain areas, to acquire of the advantages, people are expected to publish a variety of records. These, unfortunately, they did not have. The advantages, therefore, achieved them in a very restricted way. </span></span><br><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span><span style="font-size: small;">India got his freedom in the year 1947 but,denotyfied tribes has not got freedom i think,they&nbsp; are the wrenched people in India,looked by every one in India..stigma of criminalty is another qualification.no one in the parliament to voice their problems,no shelter,no food,no clothing,no education,no employment,no IAs,no IPS,even class1 government officer,no MLA,no MP in the 13 crores of dont and not people...is it the good way,right way to leave the 15% of people,99% are BPl,95% are uneducated,99% people earn the Rs 30.00per day...Is it possible to live with rupees thirty per day...? </span></span><br><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><br><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;">What Major problem denotified people face?</span></span></h3><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;">With no evidence of property or property possession accreditations, they were not in a place to acquire ration cards and had not been involved in the BPL .They also experienced a lot of problems in getting the caste accreditation and therefore no access to govt well being techniques.</span></span><br><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></span><span style='font-family: Georgia,"Times New Roman",serif;'><span style="font-size: small;">Second most problems they face is the Illiteracy.
