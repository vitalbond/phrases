<div><p>Nintendo&rsquo;s Virtual Console is one of the best features of their modern consoles and handheld gaming devices.&nbsp; It gives today&rsquo;s gamers the chance to play the nearly hundreds of amazing games that Nintendo released over the past twenty years for a reasonable price on modern systems.&nbsp; When the Wii U&rsquo;s Virtual Console was announced in North America, Nintendo promised that they would be able to bring over games from the original NES, Super Nintendo, and Game Boy Advance systems.&nbsp; While the Wii U&rsquo;s Virtual Console saw a pretty decent official launch last year with titles like <em>Super Mario World</em> and <em>Excitebike</em>, up to this point we have only seen games get released on Wii U from the NES or SNES, with no GBA titles getting a release up to this point.&nbsp; The GBA has one hell of a great back catalog of exclusive titles including <em>Pok&eacute;mon Emerald</em>, and <em>Metroid: Zero Hour</em>, and it has been a shame we have been waiting as long as we have for GBA games to get relereleased on the service.&nbsp; That is about to end.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced today they will start to release games previously exclusive to the Game Boy Advance for sale on the Wii U Virtual Console starting April 3rd, 2014.&nbsp; <em>Mario &amp; Luigi Superstar Saga</em> and <em>Metroid Fusion</em> will be the first two GBA games released through the service.</p>
<p>Each GBA game will cost $7.99 US, the same price a Super Nintendo game costs on the Wii U VC.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7050/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7050/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7050&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
