<div><p>The Xbox 360 version of the cult classic game <em>Dark Souls</em> has been made free of charge to all current Xbox Live Gold members thanks to Microsoft&rsquo;s Games With Gold promotion.</p>
<p><em>Dark Souls</em> will continue to be available to download for free to Xbox Live Gold members on the Xbox 360 until June 16th.  After the <em>Dark Souls </em>promotion expires, <em>Charlie Murder</em> and <em>Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition</em> will be made free until the end of the month.</p>
<p>Just remember, as long as you download this game during the period it is free, your ownership of this game will not expire even if your Xbox Live Gold account expires.  However, Microsoft has recently announced that when they bring this promotion to the Xbox One, you will lose access to any Xbox One games you download through Games With Gold.</p>
<p>The initial titles coming to the Xbox One&rsquo;s Games With Gold promotion are expected to be <em>Max: The Curse of Brotherhood</em> and <em>Halo: Spartan Assault.</em></p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7205/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7205/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7205&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
