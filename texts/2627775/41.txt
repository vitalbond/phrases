<div><p>Sony and Sucker Punch have announced that the second patch for the PS4 exclusive hit <em>inFAMOUS: Second Son</em> should get released some time tomorrow.&nbsp; The biggest changes the patch will make to the game include three changes specifically requested by gamers.&nbsp; Players will now have the option to change the game&rsquo;s time of day to any point they wish.&nbsp; You will also be able to cap the game&rsquo;s framerate to a maximum&nbsp;30 frames, however Sucker Punch has stated that there may be points where the game will dip below that framerate.&nbsp; Finally, you&rsquo;ll be able to turn the game&rsquo;s HUD off if you desire.</p>
<p>The new patch will also include a whole lot more than just player requested submissions,&nbsp;it will include some entirely new features such as&nbsp;Photo Mode.&nbsp; Take a look below to see for yourselves how it will work.</p>
