<div><p>What can I say about Video Games Live?&nbsp; Created by Tommy Tallarico, it is a worldwide concert series which brings the greatest music ever composed for video games to the masses.&nbsp; There are huge production values, through special&nbsp;video effects, smoke&nbsp;and&nbsp;lighting.&nbsp; You actually feel like you&rsquo;re in the game as you&rsquo;re listening to this great music being performed by the professionals in your area.&nbsp; As a gamer, gaming journalist, and music lover, I always hoped I would get the chance to check it out for myself.&nbsp; Sadly, I was never fortunate enough to get to witness a Video Games Live concert firsthand. &nbsp;It only came to my neck of the woods once and unfortunately it was a time that I could not check it out.&nbsp; A few years ago, when the organization announced they were planning to&nbsp;release the next concert album (dubbed Level 2) in High-Definition on Blu-Ray Disc, I picked up a copy on day one.&nbsp; After watching&nbsp;Level 2&nbsp;with a 1080p&nbsp;HDTV and&nbsp;top of the line&nbsp;HD surround system, I thought it would be the only way I would get to hear this fantastic performance for myself and I was not disappointed, and I sure knew I wanted to hear more.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to&nbsp;Kickstarter, Video Games Live has just released their third album, LEVEL 3, exclusively as a digital download.&nbsp; I have to say, it has been quite a treat.&nbsp; Like with the Video Games Live concert series itself, the new album features an eclectic smattering of video game songs across many different game genres. &nbsp;There are some old favorites that concert regulars may remember from earlier performances, like <em>Chrono Cross</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, but they are presented on this album&nbsp;in new arrangements.&nbsp; As for new stuff, PC gamers will appreciate the inclusion of songs from <em>Secret of Monkey Island</em> and <em>DOTA 2</em>, and console gamers will appreciate new arrangements from <em>Journey</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> and <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em>. The Level 3 album also features some surprises as well, including a new version of one of my favorite video game songs of all time, the &ldquo;Theme of Laura&rdquo; from <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, an orchestral performance of the theme to <em>Street Fighter II</em>, and to top it all&nbsp;off, a live performance of the ending&nbsp;theme to <em>Portal</em>, &ldquo;Still Alive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The album opens with &ldquo;Liberi Fatali&rdquo; from <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>. Let me tell you, the track sounded identically to how I remembered it from the game. &nbsp;In fact, as I type this up, I&rsquo;m going to look up the part in the game the song was used in just to see how close the Video Games Live version was to the original one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an energetic and powerful song that many gamers will fondly remember, and a great track to start the album with.</p>
<p>The next track is a slower ballad,&nbsp;&rdquo;Scars of Time&rdquo; from&nbsp;<em>Chrono Cross</em>, a beautiful musical piece I remember fondly from the Level 2 concert.&nbsp; In fact, it is a game one of my site contributors believes has one of the greatest soundtracks from the PS1 era, and the track included in the Level 3 album was used in what is (in his opinion) one of the best opening cutscenes to any game, period.</p>
<p>Moving on, the album continues with the theme to <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, an updated version of the original&nbsp;soundtrack designed to be played by early PC speakers.&nbsp; Once again, the orchestra does a great job performing the song exactly as you would imagine that theme would be played.&nbsp; Every bip and bloop from the original MIDI track is presented here by live real-world&nbsp;instruments, making me feel like I was listening to it for the first time all over again.&nbsp; If I ever planned to take a vacation someplace tropical, I would probably have this song as my soundtrack.</p>
<p>As a recent <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> convert, I was pleased to see the <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> theme song was included in the album.&nbsp; When I heard the <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> theme on the album for the first time I thought for sure that I was listening to the same orchestra performing it as I had heard perform it&nbsp;in the <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> TV show and feature films, only now they had the chance to truly let loose without being pressed to time constraints.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a fan of the Pok&eacute;mon games, TV show, or movies, you&rsquo;ll love hearing this track.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, this album also offers some surprises.&nbsp; One of the biggest surprises I found on this album was their version of the main theme to <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the &ldquo;Theme of Laura&rdquo;.&nbsp; Since I first heard this track several years ago, it has been one of my favorite video game compositions of all time.&nbsp; Unlike some of the other songs on the album, the VGL version of this song was not a straight pitch for pitch port of the song, but a slightly adjusted version with a tad bit more improvisation in it. If you ever wondered what the &ldquo;Theme of Laura&rdquo; would sound like if it were performed by a band like the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, you should give this one a listen.&nbsp; I loved it.</p>
<p>If you want to hear something more recent,&nbsp;look&nbsp;no further than&nbsp;the theme to the 2012 Game of the Year, <em>Journey</em>.&nbsp; The music in that game was just beautiful, and a great choice for that album.&nbsp; It was performed so perfectly, as I listened to that song I immediately felt myself flashing back to the first time I played that game&rsquo;s final moments.&nbsp; Maybe I saw you at the top of the same mountain.</p>
<p>One of the most enjoyable things I remembered from the Level 2 album was Tommy&rsquo;s updated arrangements on classic tunes not originally performed with traditional instruments, like his rockin&rsquo; arrangements of the themes to <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, <em>Mega Man</em>, and <em>Castlevania</em>. People looking for tracks like that on the Level 3 album need look no further than the second to last track on the album, the theme to&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter II</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a classic rockin&rsquo; tune that really picks up your heart rate.&nbsp; And yes, it <em>does</em> go with everything.</p>
<p>The album&rsquo;s final track is a live recording of &ldquo;Still Alive&rdquo; from <em>Portal</em>.&nbsp; It&nbsp;sounded a bit like it was being captured by a tape recorder during a live performance, but I&rsquo;m certain that&rsquo;s what the creators were going for. &nbsp;The performance itself was less about the performance by the orchestra, and more about the audience&rsquo;s love for this great song.&nbsp; Throughout the track, the audience is heard cheering, clapping and singing along.&nbsp; Never having attended a performance of the show myself, listening to the live track made me feel like I was sitting in one of those seats just for a few moments.</p>
<p>The production values on this album couldn&rsquo;t be higher. In fact, Video Games Live boasts that the Level 3 album features several well-known musicians, as well as several independent performers known for their love of the source material.&nbsp; Regardless of what kind of gamer you are, you&rsquo;ll find something in this album that you will enjoy.&nbsp; Sadly, simply describing this music in words does no justice to how it actually sounds or how it made me feel.&nbsp; The album is up for download today and&nbsp;if you are interested in picking it up you should be able to find it in the usual places, such as iTunes or Amazon.&nbsp; Anyone who funded&nbsp;the album&nbsp;through Kickstarter will probably have alternate download arrangements.&nbsp; Load the songs onto your Smartphone or MP3 player, stream them to your Stereo and enjoy.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of anything better to listen to as I wait for Quinni-Con.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/6996/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/6996/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=6996&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
