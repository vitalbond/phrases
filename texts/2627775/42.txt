<div><p>Naughty Dog has announced the third and final set of downloadable content for their 2013 Game of the Year contender, <em>The Last of Us</em>.&nbsp; The new DLC, dubbed the &ldquo;Grounded Bundle&rdquo; will include additions for both single player and multiplayer game modes.&nbsp; The first is called &ldquo;Grounded Mode&rdquo;, which is an entirely new and incredibly hard difficulty mode for the single player game.&nbsp; On the multiplayer side, a new map pack, called the &ldquo;Reclaimed Territories Map Pack&rdquo; will include four entirely new maps for multiplayer.&nbsp; Finally, there will also be some new skills and weapons packs up for purchase at the same time.</p>
<p>You can read all the specific&nbsp;details about all of the new content <a title="Playstation.Blog" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/04/16/the-last-of-us-grounded-bundle-detailed/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>All of the content will be included for free to anyone who has already purchased a Season Pass for <em>The Last of Us</em>.&nbsp; Otherwise the Grounded Mode will cost $4.99 US by itself and the new map pack will cost $9.99 US by itself.&nbsp; Just be aware that after May 13th, Sony intends to remove the Season Pass from the Playstation Store.&nbsp; Anyone who hasn&rsquo;t purchased one by then will have to purchase the game&rsquo;s DLC individually.</p>
