<div><p>Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft have all concluded their E3 Press Briefings for today. Next up will be Sony&rsquo;s. If you plan to watch the Sony E3 Press Conference tonight, Sony will be streaming the event on Ustream starting at 5:45pm (PDT).</p>
<p>However PS4 owners will be given a special way to watch the event in the form of the PS@E3 app. The app is going to do more than stream the event, it&rsquo;s going to offer gamers the chance for exclusive access to E3 information including the chance for early beta access to Playstation.Now. Take a look.</p>
