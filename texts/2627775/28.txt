<div><p>While many 3DS owners may have been first exposed to the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> series with the release of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</em> last year, I was first exposed to the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> series when <em>Bowser&rsquo;s Inside Story</em> was released on the Nintendo DS.&nbsp; Little did I know that there was a game in&nbsp;the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> series that&nbsp;was released on the GBA.&nbsp; Now, anyone who loves this awesome series who never owned the original platform it appeared on will finally be able to play it.&nbsp; <em>Mario &amp; Luigi Superstar Saga</em> will be one of the first GBA games released on the Wii U Virtual Console early next month, and here&rsquo;s the trailer for it.</p>
