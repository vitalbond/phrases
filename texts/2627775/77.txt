<div><p>With E3 a week away, I decided to fire up my PS3 and give <em>Playstation Home</em> a look. Sony&rsquo;s actually been really good over the past few years at offering exclusive content and spaces to celebrate E3 every year.&nbsp; Sony may have recently added Trophies, but after a thorough search, I noticed Sony hasn&rsquo;t activated any E3 2014&nbsp;content on <em>Home</em> just yet but after spending so much time playing Sony&rsquo;s newest console, it was surprising that I still have to use older equipment to access such an important piece of Sony&rsquo;s Playstation Network.</p>
<p>I was one of the first Beta Testers for <em>Playstation Home</em>, and over the past few years I&rsquo;ve seen it grown tremendously but even after reviewing the most recent version of the program, I&rsquo;ve noticed&nbsp;it isn&rsquo;t perfect.&nbsp; Most of these issues are actually technical.&nbsp; It reserves a lot of space in the PS3&prime;s Hard Drive, and yet most of the game&rsquo;s content is downloaded as its being accessed.&nbsp; It has a large and diverse catalog of avatar clothing and accessories, and yet it takes forever to load each user&rsquo;s appearance alongside all the other content it must load when entering a new area.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m seriously concerned that since the program has worked like this for quite a while now, users appearances are phased in like this because of hardware limitations.</p>
<p>The most logical solution to all of these technical problems with the game is to simply make it available on the Playstation 4.&nbsp; Since the PS4 has a lot more memory to offer developers, it could be able to load all of the data <em>Home</em> streams whenever you enter a new area, and possibly could hold that data in memory for longer.&nbsp; This could&nbsp;also decrease load times.&nbsp; For more than a year, <em>Playstation Home</em> has been able to sync all of a player&rsquo;s progress on their servers. So everything that a player unlocks remains consistent regardless of which console the player is using. This means <em>Home</em> could, in theory, be able to keep track of a player among multiple different platforms.</p>
<p><em>Home</em> works on a very similar income structure as the free-to-play model, and because of that&nbsp;it benefits economically by having a wide user base.&nbsp; The game is free to access to anyone with a Playstation 3, online access, and a Playstation Network account.&nbsp; It makes money by selling premium content, like Home Spaces, avatar clothing, and other digital accessories.&nbsp; Having it available on multiple platforms is the best way to ensure a wide user base, and it could attract more developers who use the free-to-play model to design premium <em>Home</em> exclusive content.</p>
<p>On a separate note, I am surprised <em>Home</em> hasn&rsquo;t been released on the Playstation Vita either.&nbsp; Why not offer Vita integration?&nbsp; The developers were talking about PSP integration ever since the closed beta, although they never did anything with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why was because Home used to have a virtual PSP as the framing device for manipulating Home&rsquo;s menus, and you could personalize it quite a bit, which was something I appreciated.&nbsp; During last year&rsquo;s E3 promotion, Sony used a virtual Playstation Vita to assist players in completing the E3 quests.&nbsp; It would have been great to actually have that information that was keeping track of my progress&nbsp;on my actual personal device, like a Vita or Playstation App compatible Smartphone/Tablet.&nbsp; The Vita&rsquo;s hardware is better than the PS3&prime;s in a lot of ways, and it can already be used as a&nbsp;PS4 second screen.&nbsp; I would love to be able to navigate all the in-game menus from a second device.</p>
<p>In short, bringing <em>Home</em> to the PS4 seems almost like a no brainer.&nbsp; In fact, I&rsquo;m shocked it wasn&rsquo;t included with the Playstation 4 at launch.&nbsp; However, the console has been out for a few months now, and I think the time is about right for Sony to make an announcement about their future plans for <em>Home</em>.&nbsp; With the PS3&prime;s lifespan starting to wind down, Sony should use this year&rsquo;s E3 to announce their future plans for the Playstation 4.&nbsp; Not only would this encourage people to buy their new console, but give early adopters a lot to be excited about.&nbsp; Anyone want to place a bet to see if <em>Home</em> PS4&nbsp;gets announced on June 9th?</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7211/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7211/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7211&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
