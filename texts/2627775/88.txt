<div><p>On the night of the PS4&prime;s launch, Developer Naughty Dog showed a teaser for what they revealed to be the next <em>Uncharted</em> game. Since then the speculation hasn&rsquo;t stopped. There were no familiar voices or images in that teaser trailer and a lot of gamers were concerned that the game would not feature the staple characters of the series like Nathan Drake and Victor &ldquo;Sully &rdquo; Sullivan.  Well, tonight at Sony&rsquo;s  E3 Press Conference, those questions were answered.</p>

<p>Anyone else notice that ring on Drake&rsquo;s finger?</p>
