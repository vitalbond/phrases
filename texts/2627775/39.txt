<div><p>Since the release of <em>inFAMOUS: Second Son</em> and <a title="Spring 2014 RPG Discussion" href="https://gamexcess.net/2014/03/21/spring-2014-rpg-discussion/" target="_blank">the great RPG deluge of Spring 2014</a>, there wasn&rsquo;t much gaming news going on to report on.&nbsp; It was one day from April 1st, and if previous experience was any indication, most of the news that would be coming out that day&nbsp;would be outright false, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have much to report on.&nbsp; Unless I&rsquo;m doing <a title="April Fools 2012" href="https://gamexcess.net/2012/04/01/contingency-broadcast/" target="_blank">an April Fools Prank of my own</a>, I don&rsquo;t like posting up fake news or false information on this site, so I was ready to just put work on the site on hold for the day.&nbsp; By the time the clock hit 7PM local time, I was just burnt out.&nbsp; So I was nursing my wounds on Twitter when a Tweet from <a title="@Pokemon" href="http://twitter.com/pokemon" target="_blank">The Pok&eacute;mon Company</a> crossed my eye.&nbsp; Google was looking for a Pok&eacute;mon Master to join their company.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t believe me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let the video explain it for you.</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="460" height="289" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4YMD6xELI_k?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, Pok&eacute;mon were in Google Maps and Google, with the blessing of The Pok&eacute;mon Company, was daring us to <em>catch &lsquo;em all</em>.&nbsp; I fired up my Google Maps app, which, in my opinion, is the best GPS available on a SmartPhone, and tapped the search bar.&nbsp; Normally I would see a record of all the previous locations I had searched for, but this time was different.&nbsp; The words &ldquo;Press Start&rdquo;,&nbsp;comprised of&nbsp;blue letters,&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;in the search menu.&nbsp; I tapped the words and the app changed, hurling my present location to the west coast of the United States.&nbsp; A pixelated building was superimposed on top of the map&rsquo;s present location, baring a very similar appearance to a Pok&eacute;mon Center.&nbsp; A few tiny, pixelated icons resembling Pok&eacute;mon surrounded the building, and the city the building was in.&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it,&nbsp;I was mapping the Pok&eacute;mon World.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the reason why <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> has worked so well as an enduring franchise for so long, is that it copies just enough of the real-world to appeal to a wide audience.&nbsp; I actually did an <a title="Pok&eacute;mon World" href="https://gamexcess.net/do-we-all-live-in-a-pokemon-world/" target="_blank">entire essay</a> on this&nbsp;phenomenon some time ago.&nbsp; In fact, the exotic lands that Pok&eacute;mon games have taken place in closely resemble real world locations, and the game&rsquo;s developers have stated on several occasions that this is no coincidence.&nbsp; The blurring of the line between&nbsp;the real world&nbsp;and&nbsp;fictional events that take place in the&nbsp;real world to promote&nbsp;the latest media release is something that marketing partners have been&nbsp;doing for at least ten years now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that many people remember the <a title="I Love Bees" href="http://www.ilovebees.com/" target="_blank">I Love Bees</a> alternate-reality game designed to promote the release of <em>Halo 2</em> in 2004,&nbsp;but it wasn&rsquo;t the first ARG ever done, and there have been many others since.&nbsp; For April Fools 2014, Nintendo was stepping into that territory, and for a short time&nbsp;the line between reality and game was going to get even blurrier.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was just how detailed the promotion was.&nbsp; Google did a great job with updating the Maps interface for this event.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t just have Pok&eacute;mon icons all over the maps that you could highlight and &ldquo;capture&rdquo;, the app&rsquo;s interface&nbsp;kept track of all the Pok&eacute;mon you currently possessed, kind of like a rudimentary Pokedex.&nbsp; Also, just like a Pokedex,&nbsp;you unlocked character bios and statistics for any Pok&eacute;mon you had captured, and you could go back and review that information as much as you needed to as you continued your search!&nbsp; The Pokedex informed me that there were only 150 Pok&eacute;mon to find, a number reminiscent of the first generation Pok&eacute;mon games.&nbsp; After combing through all the wild Pok&eacute;mon surrounding the&nbsp;starting Pok&eacute;mon Center, I was off searching the world for new Pok&eacute;mon to capture.</p>
<p>I traveled across the map, searching far and wide.&nbsp; As I searched, so did the rest of the world.&nbsp; The internet was abuzz with other Pok&eacute;mon Trainers swapping notes on where to find difficult Pok&eacute;mon all over the world.&nbsp; There was a Pidgey on the top of the CM Tower in Toronto, Canada.&nbsp; Several Pok&eacute;mon were hiding throughout Manhattan.&nbsp; The Galpagos Islands were practically brimming with all kinds of life, and not just the real kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few hours I had found what I thought was all one hundred and fifty Pok&eacute;mon and called it a night.</p>
<p>April 2nd passed, and I was fairly certain that my Pok&eacute;mon journey had come to an end.&nbsp; The joke was over and I had what I thought were all 150 Pok&eacute;mon captured.&nbsp; Little did I know that there was in fact one more to find.&nbsp; When the first Pok&eacute;mon games were released, Nintendo coded in a 151st Pok&eacute;mon which could not be obtained through normal gameplay.&nbsp; Their plan was to offer it to players who participated in official Nintendo sanctioned Pok&eacute;mon events, kind of like the DLC that you get with preordering a game today.&nbsp; The 151st Pok&eacute;mon was Mew, and Nintendo built an entire legend around this one, culminating with the story of the first <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> motion picture.</p>
<p>It turned out that Mew could also be found in Google Maps as the 151st Pok&eacute;mon, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to find.&nbsp; After doing a little research on him I discovered that Mew could only be found by Pok&eacute;mon Trainers who had already located all 150 Pok&eacute;mon, which is why he never showed up on any of my previous sweeps, and he could only be found in one location out of a pretty hefty&nbsp;list of possible locations.&nbsp; It sounded like he would be difficult to find, but I searched and searched, and eventually I did find him.</p>
<p>I have to remark on one major thing I don&rsquo;t think has been reported on by the rest of the media, and that is the educational benefits of this promotion.&nbsp; By choosing to do this event through Google Maps and hiding Pok&eacute;mon all across the world&rsquo;s map specifically, anyone who&nbsp;participated could have walked away with a little bit more experience in geography.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been hearing concerns for many years now that young people have difficulty finding the location of some pretty important countries, or the locations of certain major cities on the world map.&nbsp; Since the whole point of the Pok&eacute;mon Challenge involved using the world map&nbsp;for a giant Pok&eacute;mon safari, anyone who participated in the event could have walked away with a better understanding of geography.&nbsp; You really had to search the maps closely&nbsp;to find where Google hid all the Pok&eacute;mon, and&nbsp;even if you simply breezed through&nbsp;location to location,&nbsp;seeing the names of cities,&nbsp;towns and&nbsp;landmarks would make anyone&nbsp;exploring a location in the world they were&nbsp;unfamiliar with more familiar to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you specifically gave Google Maps the exact location specific Pok&eacute;mon could be found,&nbsp;an animation&nbsp;would move the globe from your current displayed position to the location you told it, giving anyone who searched for the location a pretty quick understanding about where in the world the location was relative to where they were searching.&nbsp; Educators are always trying to make the subjects they&rsquo;re dealing with relevant to their students, how about doing a Pok&eacute;mon search in your classroom?</p>
<p>While this was certainly designed for current&nbsp;Pok&eacute;mon fans and for the nostalgic like me who remember the height of Pok&eacute;mon fever,&nbsp;I&rsquo;m really happy that Google and Nintendo were able to do this.&nbsp; I hope that something like this comes our way again, and if it does, you can be sure I&rsquo;ll write about it.&nbsp; Happy April Fools everybody!</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7067/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7067/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7067&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
