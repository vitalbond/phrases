<div><p>I&rsquo;m one of the biggest fans of the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> franchise and I have been waiting as patiently as I could for any information on <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> after the release of <em>Ground Zeroes</em>.  I had heard it leaked at some point online but I wasn&rsquo;t able to see it during that time. Hopeful it would show during one of the E3 Press Events I waited for Sony to air this trailer at their show tonight and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.  Take a look.</p>
