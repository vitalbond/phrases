<div><p>I have been following Telltale Games ever since they released the first season of <em>Sam and Max</em>, and with the incredible word of mouth that I&rsquo;ve been hearing about one of their latest game series currently in development, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>, I had to give the series a look.&nbsp; Needless to say, the positive word of mouth was incredibly deserving, and I discovered an enriching game with an engrossing story that is still unfolding.</p>
<p>This week, Telltale has released the first trailer for <em>The Wolf Among Us Episode 3</em>, providing the first tidbits for what we can expect with this newest episode.&nbsp; Just be aware, this trailer will contain spoilers for the first two episodes, so if you haven&rsquo;t played them yet, look away now.</p>
