<div><p>Today, <em>Bioshock Infinte&rsquo;s</em> third and final DLC expansion has been released, and by now it should be available to download on all platforms, at least in North America.&nbsp; It is Episode 2 of <em>Burial at Sea</em>, a single player expansion which will conclude the <em>Burial at Sea</em> story.&nbsp; Take a look at the game&rsquo;s launch trailer.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this helps anyone, but I noticed a small bug in my version of the game and was able to rectify it.&nbsp; For some reason, the Xbox 360 version of the DLC was released in two parts, both of which you will need to download if you want to play the game.&nbsp; If you happen to download the DLC&nbsp;through the <em>Bioshock: Infinite Season Pass</em> menu on the Xbox 360 version, for some reason the game did not detect the second half of the DLC was downloaded after I finished downloading it.&nbsp; Because the game could not detect the second part was downloaded, this prevented me from playing the DLC.&nbsp; However, after restarting the game, the game was able to successfully detect the content and I was able to play it.&nbsp; Hopefully Irrational will fix this small issue in time.</p>
<p><em>Bioshock: Infinite</em> is out now on the PC, Xbox 360 and PS3.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7042/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7042/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7042&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
