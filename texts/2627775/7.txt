<div><p>The second of two major system updates to the Xbox One&rsquo;s Operating System is being phased in as I write this.&nbsp; The latest Xbox One update addresses several problems with the Xbox One&rsquo;s interface, including the Party System, Friends Lists, and includes several other optimizations and bug fixes.</p>
<p>However, the biggest addition this new update will bring probably won&rsquo;t get noticed immediatly.&nbsp; One of the first features that Microsoft showcased for the Xbox One at E3 last year was live game streaming, a feature that was not available in the Xbox One at launch (but is a feature of the Playstation 4).&nbsp; The System Update&nbsp;will allow game streaming from the Xbox One, and the feature will be available to users as soon as the Xbox One Twitch TV app gets updated some time next week.</p>
<p>Until then, check out this video from Xbox Live&rsquo;s Major Nelson on all the new features.</p>
