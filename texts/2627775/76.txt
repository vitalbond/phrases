<div><p>Just a week after the release of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, Nintendo has released a major system update to the Wii U.  Firmware 5.00 includes multiple system improvements including a faster boot option, a standby option which can send notifications to the Wii U gamepad even when the system is off, and other bug fixes and optimizations.</p>
<p>The Wii U will download the update automatically the next time it is turned on. It will notify you to perform the update upon completion. If you prefer to do the update manually, you can also update the Wii U from the System Settings menu.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7209/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7209/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7209&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
