<div><p>We are pleased to announce the release of <strong>YUI 3.16.0</strong>! This release can be found on the <a href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.16.0/build/yui/yui-min.js">Yahoo CDN</a>, through <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/yui">npm</a>, and via a downloadable <a href="http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.15.0.zip"><code>.zip</code> archive</a>. The YUI Library website has also been updated to reflect the changes in this release.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnew3160">What&rsquo;s New In This Release</h2>
<p>If there were a theme for this release, it&rsquo;s probably one of community involvement. Many of the fixes and update in this release were originated from the YUI community and simply brought in with minimal changes via the committers. Another theme would be around Loader. There were fixes in Loader to improve its speed as well as deal with various edge case issues. As usual, there were also a number of fixes and updates across the board as outlined below.</p>
<h3 id="appframeworkupdates3160">App Framework Updates</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/">App Framework</a> an issue was fixed where Router&rsquo;s <code>hasRoute(url)</code> method did not follow the same semantics as the route dispatching process. Now all registered param handlers will process any named params, giving them a chance to validate and reject a param value. This will make the <code>hasRoute()</code> method an effective way to check whether a router will dispatch to a route handler for a given URL (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/1722">#1722</a>).</p>
<h3>Calendar Updates {calendarupdates3160}</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/calendar/">Calendar</a>, Andrew Nicols fixed an issue where you could not change the month in RTL mode (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1719">#1719</a>) and the arrow itself was wrongly displayed (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1724">#1724</a>). Community member Marc Lundgren changed the arrow to display using CSS instead of an image (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1361">#1361</a>).</p>
<h3 id="cssgridschanges3160">CSS Grids Changes</h3>
<p>Pure CSS was updated to 0.4.2 and YUI imported the new version in this release. As a result in <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssgrids/">Grids</a> you can now use non-reduced fraction class names when laying out a grid. This means that we have rules for classes such as <code>.pure-u-12-24</code> as well as <code>.pure-u-1-2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="cssnormalizechanges3160">CSS Normalize Changes</h3>
<p>Also as a result of the Pure CSS update of <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssbase/">Base</a>, you can now set a <code>[hidden]</code> attribute to your HTML elements if you want them to be <code>display: none;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="datatableupdates3160">DataTable Updates</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/datatable/">DataTable</a> an issue was fixed by @<a href="https://github.com/annumanuel">annumanuel</a> were the table did not render correctly in the print preview for IE 11 (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1708">#1708</a>).</p>
<h3 id="domchanges3160">DOM Changes</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/DOM.html">DOM</a> Ryuichi Okumura optimized <code>dom-style.js</code>, removed an unnecessary anonymous function and unused variables, and changed the code to use &ldquo;Number()&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;new Number()&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="draganddropimprovements">Drag and Drop Improvements</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/dd/">Drag and Drop</a>, Andrew Nicols moved <code>preventDefault</code> to <code>gesturemovestart</code> (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1721">#1721</a>) and to invoke that <code>preventDefault</code> after movement has started (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1761">#1761</a>). Chema Balsas fixed an issue where <code>dd-proxy</code> would reset radio buttons when cloneNode==true (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/1663">#1663</a>).</p>
<h3 id="richtexteditor3160">Rich Text Editor Updates</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/io/">IO</a> there was a fix by <a href="https://github.com/goodforenergy">@goodforenergy</a> to remove the unnecessary <code>src</code> attribute of an <code>iframe</code> which had caused an extra request to be made to the current page URL when the <code>iframe</code> was included on the page. (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1646">#1646</a> ) <a href="https://github.com/customcommander">@customcommander</a> documented the usage of username/password in the Y.io configuration (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1572">#1572</a> ).</p>

<p>There were quite a few changes in <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Loader.html">Loader</a> this time around including an optimization of Loader&rsquo;s constructor (<a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1581">#1581</a>) by <a href="https://github.com/caridy">@caridy</a>. Ezequiel was busy with fixes as well including removing <code>onCSS</code> documentation since it was never implemented , fixing an issue where a module&rsquo;s <code>lang</code> packs were not being included before the module itself, an issue where conditionally loading a module using <code>before</code> did not work, and an issue where a <code>CSS</code> module could not require a <code>js</code> module (all in <a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1743">#1743</a>).</p>
