<p>In this week&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO6hbFIgQlg">YUI Open Roundtable</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/juandopazo">Juan Dopazo</a> from the YUI Team sat down with <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/twitter.com/triptych">Andrew</a> to talk about Promises and ES6 Modules in YUI. Juan stepped through what Promises are and how you can use them today. It was a great discussion that I highly recommend checking it out if you&rsquo;re new to Promises.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO6hbFIgQlg&amp;feature=share&amp;t=58m44s">Towards the end of the video</a>, Juan also talked about how you can write YUI modules in ES6 by leveraging the new <code>YUI.require()</code> method, <code>imports</code>/<code>exports</code>, and transpiling code via the <a href="https://github.com/square/es6-module-transpiler">Square ES6 Transpiler</a>.</p>

</ul><p>This was an exciting week for the team, with the release of 3.16.0 and a great Open Roundtable discussion! Remember that next Friday is Good Friday, so there will not be a YUI Weekly next week. I&rsquo;ll see you guys back here on April 25th!</p></div>
