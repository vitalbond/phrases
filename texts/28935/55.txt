<p>There was also a new release of <a href="http://yeti.cx/">Yeti</a>. We use Yeti to automate our tests across browsers.

<h1>Open Roundtable</h1>
<p>We continued our &ldquo;YUI in the Wild&rdquo; series at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiNlE8DOdus">Open Roundtable</a> this week. Mayumi joined us and discussed how she uses YUI at her work. It was an interesting conversation and I recommend checking it out.</p>
<p>If you are using YUI and you&rsquo;d like to show off what you&rsquo;ve been building, you can sign up for a spot at our Open Roundtable at <a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Open-Roundtable">this wiki</a>. Open Roundtable will return on January 9th!</p>
