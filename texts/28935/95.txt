<div><p><em>Welcome to YUI Weekly, the weekly roundup of news and announcements from the YUI team and community.</em></p>
<h2 id="release">Release News</h2>
<p>Work is ongoing on <a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Development-Schedule">Sprint 14</a>, which is slated to culminate in a YUI release on May 22nd. We have a lot of open pull requests from the community which we&rsquo;ll be reviewing and merging in over the next few days!</p>
<h2 id="yui-or">YUI Open Roundtable</h2>
<p>Since I missed a few YUI Weekly&rsquo;s, we have to do some catching-up on the Open Roundtable updates! In case you&rsquo;ve been out of the loop, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been happening:</p>
<h3>Learning Paths with Andrew Wooldridge</h3>
<p>Our very own awesome community engineer, <a href="http://twitter.com/triptych">Andrew</a>, showed off the Learning Paths that he&rsquo;s been developing. It&rsquo;s a great way for folks to understand YUI in meaningful steps.</p>

<h3>Using Promises in Mojito with Marco Asbreuk</h3>
<p>Marco dropped by for a great <em>YUI In The Wild</em> episode, where he talked about how to implement promises in a Mojito application. Lots of code shown in this Roundtable, and a must-watch if you use <a href="https://github.com/yahoo/mojito">Mojito</a>.</p>

<h3>The Modown Project by Eric Ferraiuolo and Caridy Patino</h3>
<p>Finally, last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericf">Eric</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/caridy">Caridy</a> talked about the Modown Project, which is something that we&rsquo;ve been working very hard on over the last few months. Modown is a set of components that take care of hard problems related to the web-stack so developers can focus on making apps.</p>
