<div><p>Hey everyone! It&rsquo;s Friday again, which means it&rsquo;s time to fire another callback for YUI Weekly! We&rsquo;ve got two weeks of YUI news to catch up on because of the holidays, so this one&rsquo;s going to be packed.</p>
<h1>Release News</h1>
<p>We released <strong>YUI 3.14.0</strong> on November 25th, notably containing major improvements to Charts and the work we&rsquo;ve started to do to let developers use ES6 modules with YUI. We also got a lot of great contributions from the community during this release, so a big thank you to everyone who helped to make YUI better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available for you to use <a href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.14.0/build/yui/yui-min.js">directly off our CDN</a>, as a <a href="http://yui.zenfs.com/releases/yui3/yui_3.14.0">zip</a>, or installable through <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/yui">npm</a>.</p>
<p>You can see the full list of all of the changes in <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2013/11/25/yui-3-14-0-released/">our release rollup right here</a>. Please definitely let us know if you come across any bugs by <a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues">filing an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h1>Open Roundtable</h1>
<p>This week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJPdH8xmOWg">Open Roundtable</a> kicked off <strong>YUI in the Wild</strong>, a new Roundtable series we&rsquo;re starting based on the <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/category/in-the-wild/">&lsquo;In the Wild&rsquo; blog posts</a> from quite a while back!</p>
<p>For our first guest, we had <a href="https://twitter.com/FromAnEgg">Jeff Pihach</a> from Canonical come in to talk about building <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Juju</a>&lsquo;s GUI using YUI. He showed us how the Juju team structured their YUI App Framework application, how they bundled together their modules for a long-running app, and how they extended <code>Y.Router</code> to create URL flags for beta application features. Check out the video for all of that, and a lot more!</p>
<p>The Juju GUI is open source, so you can go and <a href="https://launchpad.net/juju-gui">check out their source code online</a>!</p>
<p>If your company or team is interested in being featured on the next <strong>YUI in the Wild</strong>, feel free to contact <a href="https://twitter.com/triptych">Andrew Wooldridge</a>, our Community Engineer, and we can help you set up a time or discuss content!</p>
