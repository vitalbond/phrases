<div><p>The past few days have been filled with amazing presentations, awesome food, and great discussions with folks from all over the country at <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yuiconf/2013/">YUIConf 2013</a>. Social networks were <a href="http://topsy.com/s?q=%23yuiconf">abuzz</a> over the great talks and folks were sharing snapshots of the conference through sites like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ydn/sets/72157637390577743/">Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>We had a lot of great newcomers giving talks as well as many folks from years past, and it all came together to highlight the vibrant and growing community around YUI.</p>
