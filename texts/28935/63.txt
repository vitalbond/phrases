<div><p>As we&rsquo;ve been building things using Pure and getting feedback from other developers who are doing the same, it&rsquo;s been clear that are pain-points with Pure and CSS in general that we can alleviate. The focus of our work over the last couple months has been around page layout and involves Pure Grids + tooling.</p>
<p>For this YUI Open Roundtable, we&rsquo;d like to introduce you to the latest grid developments and tools that we&rsquo;ve created to make CSS easier and more enjoyable to write.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Mobile-first Responsive Grid</strong>: The mobile-first responsive grid allows developers to create more robust layouts for all screen sizes. We revamped the entire Pure website to use the mobile-first grid system. rework-pure-grid: We created a rework plugin that makes it easy to create a customized grid for your project. This gets around the issue of unmutable media queries. </li>
<li><strong>grunt-stripmq</strong>: We&rsquo;ve been actively working on a grunt task that lets developers write mobile-first CSS, but still makes it possible for users on IE 8 and older browsers to view the desktop-version of your site. It&rsquo;s the best of both worlds! </li>
<li><strong>grunt-css-selectors</strong>: This grunt plugin lets you mutate CSS selectors within your CSS file. This is how YUI consumes Pure, but we&rsquo;ve generalized it to work with any CSS input. </li>
</ul><p>If we have time, I&rsquo;ll also share some of the things we are planning to do next. Most of it has to do with preprocessors, semantic markup, and better integration with app code bases.</p>
