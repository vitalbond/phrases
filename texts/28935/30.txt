<div><p>Prior to my arrival, I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. This was my first internship, and all I was worried about was not being known as the intern who crashed Yahoo, or broke YUI. At the same time, with JavaScript being my favorite language, I was excited to be interning with a team that developed a major JavaScript framework. My manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/jennyd">Jenny Donnelly</a>, did an excellent job of helping me settle in to my work environment, then I hit the ground running trying to learn YUI with the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/YUI-3-Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly/dp/B00CVDUFTA">YUI 3 Cookbook</a></em>.</p>
<p>On my first day, <a href="http://purecss.io/">PureCSS</a> was just released, and there was a lot of excitement in the community about this new &ldquo;easy to use&rdquo; CSS framework. My first task was to help <a href="https://twitter.com/tilomitra">Tilo Mitra</a> develop a new layout for the layouts page on the Pure website. I was amazed how lightweight Pure was, and how easy it was to develop a complex layout that maintains responsiveness.</p>
<p>Soon after working on the layout for Pure, I started fixing bugs for <a href="https://github.com/yui/metrotester">MetroTester</a>, the native WinJS app YUI uses to run tests on Windows 8. YUI had recently hired <a href="https://twitter.com/clarler">Clarence Leung</a>, who interned last year, and he helped me get familiar with the Windows 8 JavaScript API, WinJS. It was cool learning that JavaScript could be used to develop native Windows apps for its app store.</p>
<p>Working on Pure and MetroTester was a great way for me to get used to my work environment, submit a few pull requests, and run tests. Leading up to this point, Jenny asked me to come up with a project idea that I would like to work on for the rest of the summer. Being a young developer, my primary goal was to learn the best software engineering practices, specifically for building large-scale JavaScript applications. I started a project called PearlEdit, which was a web page WYSIWYG editor. I learned how to develop an app using the MVC pattern using YUI&rsquo;s <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/">App Framework</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>.</p>
<p>I realize that after spending my last three months exploring many of YUI&rsquo;s modules, there was no way that I would have made the same amount of progress that I have with building my summer project using vanilla JavaScript. When building large-scale applications, structure is important, and the App Framework allowed me to write a scalable and maintainable application. I refer to YUI as a full &ldquo;Front-end stack&rdquo;. Users are able to develop modular applications with a uniform stack, without having to mix in various libraries and MVC frameworks.</p>
<p>My time spent with YUI was an invaluable experience that has changed the way I code. I learned a lot from working with an excellent group of engineers, and their ability to answer any question served as a valuable resource. I consider myself fortunate for being able to work with a team that has a history of making many contributions to the JavaScript community. Upon my arrival back to school, I&rsquo;ll be happy to tell my friends why they should use YUI and about an amazing summer with both Yahoo and YUI.</p></div>
