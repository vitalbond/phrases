<p>I&rsquo;ll share more about the trip later&hellip;</p>
<p>I flew into San Jose airport last night. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice little airport where the immigration and customs agents are very nice and welcoming. </p>
<p>It strange because when you enter foreign countries the people are welcoming, but when you return to the US the agents are usually rude. </p>
<p>Anyway, getting through the airport was a breeze. </p>
<p>But&hellip; When you get to the curbside there are people everywhere asking you if you want some kind of ride. I&rsquo;m very hessistant in these situations in foreign countries because I don&rsquo;t speak the language. </p>
<p>There was a nice Costa Rican who asked me what I was looking for. I told him my airport had a shuttle, thinking he was just trying to get me to ride in a cab and collect his tip. But to my surprise he asked what hotel, so I told him (the barcelo), and totally hooked me up with the driver I needed. </p>
<p>After a short 20 min wait I was in the van headed to my hotel. </p>
<p>It was a 15 min ride before we pulled up to the barcelo palicio in San Jose. </p>

I should also note, the wifi at the Barcelo is fantastic!!! It&rsquo;s a 5 star wifi experience. </p>
<p>After scrapping up some delicious ceviche I hit the sack. It was early, but nursing a little cold made me want to get rested up. </p>
<p>I the morning I ate copious amounts of omelette at the all you can eat buffet, and then found my CrossFit gym of choice. </p>
<p>I went with CrossFit 506 which was about three miles from my hotel. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the roads around San Jose don&rsquo;t work well for walkers or runners, so I decided to take a cab. </p>
<p>To my surprise CrossFit 506 was awesome! They have two large floors that allow for classes individual worker outters at the same time. </p>
<p>I did my best working out with the cold I had, but still got a good workout. Working out in the Costa Rican humidity is different if you&rsquo;re used to Seattle winter weather. It&rsquo;s warm! </p>
<p>My cab driver was nice enough to wait for me while I worked out, and made my ride back to the hotel a breeze. </p>
<p><a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4507.jpg"><img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4507-300x225.jpg" alt="costa rica" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5774"></a>Now I sit by the pool, pacing around because I&rsquo;m not good at sitting, and thinking about where I&rsquo;m going to get my next meal. </p>
<p>In about 12 hours from now I&rsquo;ll meet up with the Costa Rica Fitness Vacation participants, and we&rsquo;ll take the drive to out private villas in Manuel Antonio. </p>
<p>From there the fitness vacation will take over, and we&rsquo;ll be working out, surfing, swimming, hiking, river rafting, and canyoning (zip lining). </p>
<p>Bring on the fun!</p>
