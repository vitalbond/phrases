<p>This is my very first interview on the AllAroundJoe podcast, and I&rsquo;m excited to change up the format a bit.  </p>
<p>Scott has a wealth of knowledge as it relates to getting a CrossFit gym up and running.  He started in the park with just a few people, and now has over 160 members. </p>
<p>In this podcast we talk about how to start a CrossFit gym from the grassroots of a park, when to move to a larger location, when to move to your own location, and when to hire people.  </p>
<p>The information will meet you where you&rsquo;re at, and give you perspective if you&rsquo;re looking to open you&rsquo;re own CrossFit gym.</p>
