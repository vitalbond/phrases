<div><p>This is a post/podcast for people that want to get better at CrossFit.  </p>
<p>You might be a competitor, and want to make it to Regionals, or the CrossFit Games.</p>
<p>Or you might want to simply get better, and see more results faster at you local CrossFit box.  </p>
<p>Either way, you will get some gold nuggets out of this podcast.</p>
<p>Here are some of the important things to consider if you want to become a better CrossFit athlete at any level&hellip;</p>
<h5>Use great technique</h5>
<p>This should be common sense, but you&rsquo;d be surprised how many people sacrifice form for going faster.  Trust me when I say, it&rsquo;s just not worth it.  You will eventually end up injured and sitting on the CrossFit bench.  Have you coaches help you with good technique, and watch videos of other top CrossFit and Olympic lifting athletes. </p>
<h5>Watch videos of other top athletes</h5>
<p>These are some of the athletes that post quality videos that I follow &ndash; </p>

<h5>Workout with athletes that are better than you are</h5>
<p>This is where you need to leave your pride at the door.  It&rsquo;s fun to win workouts, but if you&rsquo;re winning them all the time (and not a Games athlete) then you need to consider who you&rsquo;re working out with.  You will get better faster if you&rsquo;re working out with people who are stronger and faster than you are.  If this means finding a different gym, do it.  Or it could mean following a blog where you post your weights and times against other athletes. </p>
<h5>Go to athletes camps</h5>
<p>Go to camps like Invictus, Coach B Oly clinic, or local camps that sound interesting.  You can always learn something new.  I was recently at an Invictus athletes camp, and learned a small nugget that completely changed the way that I snatch.  It was AWESOME!</p>
<h5>Follow other athletes on Twitter</h5>
<p>This might sound just like the videos section above, but it&rsquo;s a little different.  The reason is&hellip; Twitter is different.  What does that mean?  Twitter is very unique in that it allows regular people to contact almost anyone.  Well, with the exception of super celebrities, but they might even answer you sometimes.  </p>
<p>I recommend following the athletes that you look up to, and when appropriate ask them questions related to things they are posting about.  You&rsquo;ll be surprised how many responses you get.  Just make sure that you don&rsquo;t abuse this. </p>
<h5>Work really hard!</h5>
<p>Lastly, you need to give 100% when you are working out, eating, resting, taking supplements, etc.  If if has to do with becoming a better CrossFit athlete you need to work really hard at it.  You&rsquo;ll benefit if you take this practice into all your life endeavors.  </p>
