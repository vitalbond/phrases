<div><p><a href="http://crossfitinvictus.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Invictus</a> Workout of the Day<br>
A.<br>
Three sets, not for time, of:<br>
15? Rope Climbs x 2-3 ascents<br>
Handstand Walk x 10-15 meters<br>
Toes to Bar x 10-12 reps<br>
B.<br>
Five sets for times of:<br>
5 Power Cleans (225/145 lbs)<br>
10 Chest-to-Bar Pull-Ups<br>
Rest 60 seconds<br>
Rest 5 minutes, and then&hellip;<br>
C.<br>
Five sets for times of:<br>
Row 250 Meters<br>
5 Power Snatches (135/95 lbs)<br>
Rest 60 seconds<br>
Rest 5 minutes, and then&hellip;<br>
D.<br>
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 5 minutes of:<br>
10 Front Squats (135/95 lbs)<br>
10 Pull-Ups<br>
20 Double-Unders</p>
<p>Results<br>
A. Done &ndash; rope climbs felt good. Handstand walking felt better when I remembered to quickly but consistently breath.<br>
B. :39, :57, 1:01, 1:26, 1:19<br>
C. 1:20, 1:16, 1:25, 1:24, 1:30<br>
D. 3 +10<br>
Notes: 225 power cleans were better than expected, but c2b pull-ups were much harder following them, or I wasn&rsquo;t warmed up enough. I need to get better at chest to bar butterflies. </p>
<p>What went good&hellip;<br>
B. Power cleans at 225 were cycled for the first time.<br>
C. Snatches were fast and unbroken.<br>
D. Pull-ups and double unders were fast, and unbroken with little transition rest. </p>
<p>What would I change&hellip;<br>
B. I would warm up a little on butterfly chest to bar pull-ups. Then I could hopefully go unbroken on these.<br>
C. Make sure to row at 1:35/500 or less even if it hurts.<br>
D. Do the front squats faster. I&rsquo;m not going to fail on these. Legs don&rsquo;t feel good, but I have to keep moving fast, and not wait on transitions. Exhale. </p>
