<div><p>Have you ever worked for something day in and day out for over two years?</p>
<p>I guess you could say you worked that hard for college (if you went). </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about working on one thing, or one practice, or one subject. </p>
<p>Have you ever done that for over two years?</p>
<p>For the last two plus years, all I have been doing is training to make it to the CrossFit regionals as an athlete. </p>
<p>And last weekend that goal was accomplished. </p>
<p>Our team StoneWay CrossFit worked our butts off to qualify as one of the top 30 teams in the North West region of the world wide CrossFit Open. </p>
<p>We trained through broken ribs, tendinitis, overtraining, and constant fatigue. But in the end it was all worth it. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the CrossFit regionals story&hellip;</p>
<p>On Friday morning at 7am we arrived at the ShoWare arena. Coffees in hand, and nerves running on high, we checked into the athletes area. I don&rsquo;t know if it was because I was so nervous, but it felt like you could feel everyone&rsquo;s nerves like a misty cloud as you moved through the arena. </p>
<p>There were 30 teams, some of which had been there before, and others who had never been in an environment like that. But all of them were in amazing shape, and ready to compete. </p>
<p>Stay tuned for the rest&hellip;.</p>
