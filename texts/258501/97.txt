<div><p>I’m going to try my best to get this back up and running.  It’s a great practice of journaling how I’ve felt during a day, and workout.  It also gives me the ability to look back on the day to see how things went for future reference.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crossfitinvictus.com/wod/june-11-2014-competition/" target="_blank"><strong>Invictus Workout of the Day</strong></a><br>
A.<br>
Every minute, on the minute, for 15 minutes:<br>
High Hang Clean + Clean @ 65-80% of 1-RM Clean</p>
<p>Do not allow your chest to tilt forward over the barbell on the high hang clean – dip straight down by pushing knees out and driving hard to full hip extension, then be quick under the barbell.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>These felt pretty easy at first, but the high number of reps caught up to me.  I was thinking I would jump up to my high percentage of 245 early on, but that game plan changed.  The tough part was the second rep from the ground.</p>
<p>B.<br>
Every minute, on the minute…<br>
Back Squat<br>
*Set 1 – 40% x 1 rep<br>
*Set 2 – 50% x 1 rep<br>
*Set 3 – 60% x 1 rep<br>
*Set 4 – 70% x 1 rep<br>
*Set 5 – 80% x 1 rep</p>
<p>and then….</p>
<p>Every 2 minutes…<br>
*Set 6 – 85% x 1 rep<br>
*Set 7 – 90% x 1 rep<br>
*Set 8 – 95% x 1 rep</p>
<p>and then…<br>
One set of:<br>
80% Back Squat x Max Reps @ 20X1<br>
(no excessive pause at the top – you get one full breath cycle, exhale, inhale, brace and descend – if you take longer than that your set is over)</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>The squats felt good today.  I was happy that I hit 405 without too much of a struggle, and I’m excited to slingshot past my previous PR of 425 in the near future.  The high rep set at the end didn’t go so well.  I couldn’t find my breathing rhythm, and that quickly stopped me in my tracks.</p>
<p>C.<br>
Complete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes:<br>
10 Burpee Box Jump-Overs (24?/20?)<br>
15 Deadlifts (225/155 lbs)<br>
20 Pull-Ups<br>
25 Wall Ball Shots (30/20 lbs)<br>
30 Double-Unders<br>
Rest 4 minutes, and then repeat.</p>
<p>Note rounds and reps for both sets separately.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>This looked like it was going to hurt, but to my surprise, it went pretty well.  Burpees were slow, deadlifts and pullups went unbroken, I had the lopsided wall ball so that was a bummer :-), and double unders were unbroken.  The places that I could have moved faster were the burpees and the wall balls, otherwise it went great.</p>
<p>D.<br>
Three sets of:<br>
Weighted GHD Hip Extension x 6-8 reps @ 2014<br>
Rest 30 seconds<br><a style="color: #1fb010;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfQT3gm2PlI" target="_blank">Seated Leg Curls with Band</a> x 12-15 reps<br>
Rest as needed</p>
