<p>Results<br>

C. 8, 7, 7, 6, 7<br>
D. Done. All UB.</p>
<p>What went good&hellip;<br>
A. Front squats were done at 85% and felt strong when I presses down with my toes.  Not on my toes, but using them to connect to the floor.<br>
D.Wall balls were easy. Chest to bar pull-ups felt the best they ever have.  I learned that I was muscling too much with my arms, rather than letting my legs drive me up and using my arms to navigate to the bar. </p>
<p>What would I change&hellip;<br>
B. Cleans just didn&rsquo;t feel powerful or fast today.<br>
C. On the ground to overhead I need to really make sure to hit my front rack position before the press.</p>
