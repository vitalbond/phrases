<div><p>A few months back I had a friend tell me that I needed to try a product called <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tail wind nutrition" target="_blank">Tailwind Nutrition</a>.  She said it was an endurance product, and that I should look at it even if I didn&rsquo;t have any endurance events on my schedule in the near future.</p>
<p>I immediately went to the <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tailwind nutrition" target="_blank">Tailwind Nutrition</a> website to see what they were all about.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/"><img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tailwind-nutrition.jpg" alt="tailwind nutrition" width="600" height="158" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5592"></a></p>
<p>What I found was a very pure carbohydrate and electrolyte product designed for serious endurance athletes.  Basically the product is designed to keep you energized during long endurance races and training.  And that&rsquo;s all you need to be taking.  </p>
<p>I was interested, but maybe not for the reasons you&rsquo;d think&hellip;</p>
<p>Right now my training is focused on getting better at CrossFit, and one of the major factors in getting better at CrossFit is RECOVERY.  </p>
<p>In fact, I believe that the major reason that some people don&rsquo;t get better at CrossFit as fast as they could is because they don&rsquo;t take recovery seriously enough.  </p>
<h4>What am I getting at here&hellip;</h4>
<p>Well, the reason that a lot of CrossFitters don&rsquo;t recover as well as they should is because they don&rsquo;t get enough carbohydrates.  Especially post workout.  </p>
<p>AND, that&rsquo;s exactly why I was super interested in <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tailwind nutrition" target="_blank">Tailwind Nutrition</a>.  They have a product that is perfect for post workout CrossFit recovery.</p>
<h4>How it worked&hellip;</h4>
<p>I added the <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tailwind nutrition" target="_blank">Tailwind Nutrition</a> product to my post workout nutrition.  I would drink it down with Progenex, and creatine.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/"><img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tailwind-nutrition-products.png" alt="tailwind nutrition" width="373" height="234" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5593"></a>I also played with drinking just the <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tailwind nutrition" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> product about 30 mins before my workout, and sipping on it during the weight lifting portion of my workouts.  </p>
<p>I found that while taking the <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tailwind" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> product as a recovery drink I felt all around more energized during my weekly workouts.  </p>
<p>And when I took it before and during my workouts, I felt a very slight, but immediate energy increase.  </p>
<h4>How much</h4>
<p>My serving size of <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tailwind nutrition" target="_blank">Tailwind Nutrition</a> post workout was 50-75 grams depending on how hard the workout was.  And if I was taking it pre workout I only had 25 grams.</p>
<h4>Where to buy</h4>
<p>You can pick it up at <a href="http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/" title="tailwind nutrition" target="_blank">http://TailwindNutrition.com</a></p>
