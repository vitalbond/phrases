<div><p>I was recently sent a pair of the Tommie Copper recovery compression running tights.  I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of compression tights so I was excited to give these a review.  </p>

<p>Right out of the box the tights were impressive.  </p>
<p>The material was thicker than I was used to.  To me this was a good thing.  A lot of times you&rsquo;ll have compression tights on, and the wind blows right through them, so you have to wear multiple layers.  And my preference is to wear the tight with a pair of short on top.</p>
<p>After pulling on the Tommie Copper tights for the first time I liked how tight they were around my knees.  </p>
<p>Once concern I had was they went very high on my waist.  But I was able to simply roll them down to the level that I liked.  </p>
<p>One problem with a lot of compression tights is that they slide down as you wear them.  I&rsquo;m convinced they will all do this, but it&rsquo;s a question of how much (and often) will they slide down&hellip;</p>
<p>The Tommie Copper tights had what I would call, a less than average slide down rate.  Meaning I didn&rsquo;t have to pull them up as often as the average compression tight.  That being said, they still definitely need to be pulled up a few times during the day to keep that good feeling fit.</p>

<p>Overall, I really enjoyed wearing the Tommie Copper recovery compression running tights.  </p>
<p>I typically wear them on my recovery days from CrossFit where I might go for an easy run, or do some rowing on the erg. </p>
