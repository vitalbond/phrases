<div><p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking&hellip;  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bold statement.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, it is.</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/dangerous-diet-trend-cotton-ball-diet/story?id=20942888"><img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cotton_ball_diet-300x215.png" alt="cotton_ball_diet" width="300" height="215" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5569"></a>But I just heard that there&rsquo;s a new diet out there where people are eating cotton balls with orange juice to lose weight.  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/dangerous-diet-trend-cotton-ball-diet/story?id=20942888" title="cotton ball diet" target="_blank">Read full story here</a>. </p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a serious problem if people think it&rsquo;s a good idea to eat cotton balls for any reason.</p>
<p>I heard that some celebrities are doing it, and it&rsquo;s always a good idea to do what celebrities do&hellip;.</p>
<p>What kills me is that someone will eat cotton balls with orange juice instead of simply eating right, and exercising for a few hours a week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that simple.  Really!</p>
<p>You know what&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s not those peoples fault.  Maybe it&rsquo;s the school systems that aren&rsquo;t teaching people about nutrition and exercise.  </p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>I did go to San Diego State University to get my degree in Kinesiology with an emphasis in fitness, nutrition, and health, BUT can tell you that the majority of what actually works I learned on my own through self testing, and reading about others self testing.</p>
<p>So, that tells me that our education system, even at the highest level, is pretty messed up as it comes to nutrition and exercise.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I have titled this &ldquo;why you&rsquo;re not in shape&rdquo;.  If nothing else to get your attention, and force some education down your throat.  No one else is going to do it!</p>
<p>If you think our education system needs a serious overhaul let me know.  I want to hear it in the comments below.  Tell me what you learned in school.  </p>
<p>School is supposed to get you ready for &ldquo;real life&rdquo;, right?  Did it work?  Do you know how go gain or lose weight when you want to? </p>
