It is an elevation extravaganza that most people decide to do in 5+ days.  But we decided that all of the fun would be had if we did it in 3 days.  </p>
<p>Do you think we were correct?  Haha!</p>

<p>This post talks about everything from planning, to what we brought with us each day, to what our crew brought and helped us with.</p>
