<p>It&rsquo;s not a straight forward answer, unfortunately. </p>
<p>How often should you do cardio?</p>
<p>The answer is&hellip;. it depends. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I recommend. </p>
<p>Start off with 3 times a week, for 20 mins, at a moderate intensity.  A moderate intensity is such that you can carry on a conversation, but it&rsquo;s not super easy. Or if you&rsquo;re already doing 30 mins, 3 times a week start there.  Start where you are now, and build off of that. </p>
<p>Now here comes the important part.</p>
<p>You have to change &ldquo;something&rdquo; on a regular basis, let&rsquo;s say, every week, or once you stop seeing results.  This is the only way to keep the results coming.</p>
<p>What does this all mean?</p>
<p>Well, the easiest way of doing this is picking one factor to change (or increase) each week.  And the best way to remember it is through the FITT principle.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> &ndash; The number of times you do cardio per week.<br><strong>Intensity</strong> &ndash; Your heart rate. Essentially do the cardio at a faster pace.<br><strong>Time</strong> &ndash; The duration of each cardio session.<br><strong>Type</strong> &ndash; The type of cardio (running, biking, rowing, etc). </p>
<p>The factor that you should choose to increase first is up to you, and can depend on your lifestyle.  For example, if you&rsquo;re a busy person, the most time effective choice is to increase the intensity or change the type of cardio.</p>
<p>Or&hellip; if you really enjoy cardio, maybe you choose to add another day to the week. </p>
<p>You will continue to make these adjustments until you&rsquo;ve reached your body composition goals.  But remember, it is possible to overtrain yourself.  Listen to your body, and if you feel down-and-out, give yourself some time off.</p>
