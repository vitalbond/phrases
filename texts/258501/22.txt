<div><p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s not often that a day goes by when I don&rsquo;t get asked a question about how to get motivated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For some reason motivation to workout is something that people struggle with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For me this has always been easy, and today I&rsquo;m going to share my motivational strategies with you.</p>
<ol><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Post picture of people you want to look like.</p>
<ol><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">You can easily find these picture in magazines, or on the internet. &nbsp;Then post them in places that you will see them daily. &nbsp;I have pictures posted as the desktop background of my computer.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Write down your fitness goal daily.</p>
<ol><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Do this at the start of each day, and you&rsquo;ll notice that it sets the tone for the whole day ahead. &nbsp;Even if something throws you off, you&rsquo;ve already set your target for the day, and accomplishing it becomes so much easier.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Find a motivated workout partner to feed off of. Remember, we are who we hang around.</p>
<ol><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Look into your circle of friends, and start to hangout with your buddy who works out all the time. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t have any of these friends&hellip; go to the gym, and just strike up friendly conversations. &nbsp;This will create a new group of friends that is into the healthy lifestyle that you want to achieve.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Visualize your success daily.</p>
<ol><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Right after writing your goal, or right before you fall asleep, close your eyes and visualized yourself already accomplishing the goals that you have set for yourself. &nbsp;Do this everyday, and you&rsquo;ll start to see those results come easier and easier.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Measure your progress weekly.</p>
<ol><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This can be done via a body fat test, or simply writing down the progress in your visual appearance. &nbsp;Write this down in the same journal that you use for your goal writing.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bonus! Find someone that you want to impress.</p>
<ol><li dir="ltr">Find a girl or guy that you&rsquo;d like to impress and think about them during your workouts, or when you&rsquo;re struggling to get to the gym. &nbsp;This could be someone that you like, or your husband or wife. &nbsp;The motivation of wanting to impress someone can be incredibly powerful. &nbsp;Use this!</li>
