<p>Well, I&rsquo;m the type of person that finds out why these products are better than the rest.  There&rsquo;s always a reason.  </p>
<p>In this episode of the AllAroundJoe podcast I interview the <a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/blonyx" title="Blonyx.com" target="_blank">Blonyx HMB + Creatine</a> creator Rowan Minnion.  </p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll hear in the podcast Rowan is an exceptional thinker who went about creating the <a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/blonyx" title="Blonyx hmb + creatine" target="_blank">Blonyx HMB + Creatine</a> product in a very unique way.  A very smart way!  He studied which supplements had the most conclusive research done on them, and the two that jumped out far above the rest were&hellip; you guessed it&hellip; HMB and creatine.  </p>
<p>Not only were HMB and creatine the most studied (by a wide margin), but they also had the most positive results.  Long term, and short term. </p>
<p>Rowan essentially reverse engineered the supplement creation process.  </p>
<p>Rather than going after the product that had the most hype, he went after the product that he knew would work the best, HMB and creatine.  From there he sourced the highest quality HMB and creatine products for Blonyx HMB + Creatine.  </p>
<p>Rowan also talks about how they hand make their product to guarantee the highest purity.  </p>
<p>This is really an amazing interview that I highly recommend that you listen to for yourself. </p>
