<div><p>Recently I was sent a handful of supplements by the company Now Foods.</p>
<p>I have been taking Now Foods sports supplements for years, and was excited to try what they sent me.</p>
<p>The products that I was most excited about were the Pea Protein, the MCT Oil, and the unflavored Whey Protein.</p>

<h5>Why the Pea protein?</h5>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of whey protein because it&rsquo;s so easy for our bodies to use, but there are a lot of people out there why have trouble with dairy allergies. In fact, I&rsquo;d say that I run into someone with dairy allergies on a weekly basis. So, having a great protein powder alternative for them is a must.</p>
<p>The Pea protein alone actually isn&rsquo;t a complete protein, meaning you have to combine it with other amino acids to make the protein usable in your body. This is why Now Foods has a complete amino acid complex added to the Pea protein powder.</p>
<p>The taste is actually pretty good. I like it a lot better than other protein powders that I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p>I would suggest the Now Foods Pea protein to anyone who needs a protein powder that is dairy free. Now Food is a very competitively priced product that performs.</p>
<h5>Why the MCT Oil?</h5>
<p>With the MCT (multi chain triglycerides), we all need them, and most of us probably don&rsquo;t get enough. They will help with brain function, fat metabolism, and hunger satiety. Not bad, huh&hellip; And if you&rsquo;ve heard the hype around Bulletproof Coffee, you know that MCT Oils are a great way to get you morning started.</p>
<p>I usually add my MCT Oil to coffee or into my meal replacement (mid day) protein shake. It actually gives the coffee or shake a creamy taste. I&rsquo;ve also heard of it being used as a salad dressing, but haven&rsquo;t tried that, yet.</p>

<h5>Why the Whey Protein?</h5>
<p>Well, as of right now&hellip; I can handle whey protein. Knock on wood! And because it&rsquo;s the easiest way to get protein (amino acids) to your muscles after a tough workout, I use it religiously.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about the Now Foods Whey Protein is that it&rsquo;s UNFLAVORED! Meaning no artificial sweeteners or sugars. Now I understand that this might be a turnoff for some of you, but let&rsquo;s be honest, we don&rsquo;t really know what all of these artificial sweeteners are doing to our bodies. And because of that, I avoid them whenever I have the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>The taste of the unflavored Whey Protein isn&rsquo;t bad. It&rsquo;s easy to get down, and fairly bland tasting. If you&rsquo;re using the Whey Protein as a post workout supplement, mix it with some Now Foods Dextrose and get the ultimate glycogen and amino acid replenishment. Think 3-1 or 4-1 ratio of carbs to protein when mixing that cocktail.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>If you cannot tell already, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Now Foods, and getting to try these supplements has been awesome!</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you give them a try for yourself, and if you have any questions about the products, or which to choose, leave me a comment below.</p>
