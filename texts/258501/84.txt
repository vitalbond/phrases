<div><p>Muscle soreness is just part of working out.  Actually it&rsquo;s just part of living.  Assuming you&rsquo;re living hard!  <img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"></p>
<p>What happens is you work hard in the gym, or in some physical way, and you create micro tears in your muscles.  These micro tears are small damages to the muscle that cause that still &ldquo;sore&rdquo; feeling.  As long as the tears aren&rsquo;t too big, they are actually a good thing.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll find is the soreness is a sign that your muscles will be adapting, and coming back stronger in the days to come.  </p>
<p>That being said, it is a good idea to try to recover from the soreness as fast as you can.  And get back to your awesome feeling self.  </p>
<p>The best thing you can do to get on the recovery track is&hellip; move.  Yep, get moving.  This doesn&rsquo;t have to be anything too hard.  Just some simple jogging, hiking, swimming, etc. is a great way to get the blood flowing through your sore muscles.  The new blood flow will bring with it nutrients that will help you muscles recover faster. </p>
<p>The less active things that you can do to get your muscles to recovery from soreness are: salt baths, massages, foam rolling, smashing, rest, and nutrition.</p>
<p>Listen to the podcast for me to go into detail on all of this topic. </p>
