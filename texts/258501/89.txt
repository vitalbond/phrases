<div><p>This is my complete review of the <a href="https://www.arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=2070&amp;menuId=185&amp;withLinks=1" title="arbonne vegan protein" target="_blank">Arbonne vegan protein powder</a>.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that you are wondering why I&rsquo;m trying a vegan protein powder&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not vegan at all.  In fact, I consume about 2-3 pounds of meat a day.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=2070&amp;menuId=185&amp;withLinks=1"><img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/arbonne-vegan-protein.jpg" alt="arbonne vegan protein" width="280" height="300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5796"></a>A good friend of mine asked if I&rsquo;d like to give the vegan protein a review on my blog&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and I wanted to see if switching to a vegan post workout protein powder would work.</p>
<p>&hellip;Or would fall flat on it&rsquo;s face.  Pulling me down with it.  </p>
<p>Quick note:  Something that really peaked my interest was that the <a href="https://www.arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=2070&amp;menuId=185&amp;withLinks=1" title="arbonne vegain" target="_blank">Arbonne vegan proteins</a> are certified vegan, Kosher, and gluten free</p>
<p>In doing my research before trying Arbonne&rsquo;s vegan protein powder, I found that several competitive athletes are vegans.  Including:<br>
- Olympian <strong>Carl Lewis</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis" title="Carl Lewis wikipedia" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis</a>)<br>
- Ultra running champion <strong>Scott Jurek</strong> (<a href="http://scottjurek.com/bio/" title="Scott Jurek bio" target="_blank">http://scottjurek.com/bio/</a>)<br>
- CrossFitter <strong>Ed Bauer</strong> (<a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/crossfit/ed-bauer-the-poster-man-for-vegan-crossfitters" title="Ed Bauer" target="_blank">http://breakingmuscle.com/crossfit/ed-bauer-the-poster-man-for-vegan-crossfitters</a>).</p>
<p>This gave me some confidence that eating vegan could work, and got me excited to give the <a href="https://www.arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=2070&amp;menuId=185&amp;withLinks=1" title="arbonne vegan protein powder" target="_blank">Arbonne vegan protein powder</a> a try.</p>
<p>When the bag arrived I was impressed with the presentation.  It&rsquo;s very similar to the other high end protein powders on the market.  But don&rsquo;t worry, presentation means nothing compared to performance.  I won&rsquo;t take something that looks good, unless it also crushes the recovery process.</p>
<p>My intention for the <a href="https://www.arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=2070&amp;menuId=185&amp;withLinks=1" title="arbonne vegan" target="_blank">Arbonne vegan protein</a> was a post workout recovery protein powder because it&rsquo;s high protein, low fat, and there are some sugars.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to break right into the results that I saw while taking the <a href="https://www.arbonne.com/shop_online/showitem.asp?ProductId=2070&amp;menuId=185&amp;withLinks=1" title="arbonne vegan proteins" target="_blank">Arbonne vegan protein</a>.</p>
<h4>Successes during this 4 week period&hellip;</h4>
<p>280 pound power clean (20# pr)<br>
366 reps on CrossFit Open workout 14.1 (57th in the NorthWest)</p>
<p>I also increased my cardiovascular training schedule which will usually decrease some strength, but I didn&rsquo;t notice any decrease.</p>
<h4>Let&rsquo;s talk feelings</h4>
<p>I felt good, and recovered when taking the Arbonne protein powder.  I would take it post workout with about 12 ounce of grape juice.  Well, I took the protein powder with water, and then drank the grape juice.</p>
<h4>Taste&hellip;</h4>
<p>This is not the best tasting protein powder that I&rsquo;ve ever had, but I shared it with at least 3 different people that said they liked it.  So, it&rsquo;s not terrible, and you just might enjoy it. <img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"></p>

Just so you know, my diet is always very good, sleep is always 9+ hours a night, and workouts are intense.  </p>
<h4>Who do I think this Arbonne vegan protein is for?</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this protein is superior for recovery to the non-vegan protein powders that I&rsquo;ve tested, but it is in the same ballpark, and I do know that it is a GREAT protein powder for people that are vegan, Kosher, dairy, or gluten free.  I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s very high quality. </p>
