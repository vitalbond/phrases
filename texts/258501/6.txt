<div><p>How to prepare mentally is something that can be related to almost any part of your life.  </p>
<p>But in this podcast (and post) we&rsquo;re talking about how to prepare mentally for getting to the gym, performing at the gym, and endurance/marathons.</p>
<p>The mental preparation that will get you into the gym involves writing down your goals, finding pictures of people that you want to looks like, and putting those things in front of you consistently.  </p>
<p>You must know your why.  </p>
<p>Why do you really want to look good, feel good, and be healthy?</p>
<p>My why is that I want to be the absolute best that I can be, and I want to show others what is possible.  To inspire!</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about preparing to perform great in the gym, it&rsquo;s about visualizing the completion of your goals.  Really making them a reality in your mind.  And&hellip; presenting the body language that inspires confidence.  </p>
<p>Lastly, the mental preparation for doing endurance races is similar to performing well in the gym.  Seeing your self complete the race in your mind is a must.  It&rsquo;s also a huge advantage to learn how to meditate during your endurance sports.  Calm your mind and body while moving.  This was a huge asset while I was running 50 mile ultra marathons, and doing Ironman events.  You can really relax, and calm your whole mind and body.</p>
