<p>If I were to guess, I&rsquo;d say, not many of you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the exact reason why when <a href="http://www.repfitness.com/rep-medicine-wall-balls" title="rep fitness" target="_blank">Rep Fitness</a> asked me what piece of equipment I&rsquo;d like to try out, I choose the wall ball.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the better CrossFitters at my gym likes to call them &ldquo;soul crushers&rdquo;.  </p>
<p>And I know many people feel the same way.</p>
<p>So in my effort to find you the easiest wall ball in existence, here&rsquo;s my <a href="http://www.repfitness.com/rep-medicine-wall-balls" title="rep fitness wall ball" target="_blank">Rep Fitness wall ball</a> review. </p>
<h3>The Wall Ball</h3>
<p>I chose a <a href="http://www.repfitness.com/rep-medicine-wall-balls" title="wall ball" target="_blank">20 pound wall ball</a> to do for my testing.  </p>
<p>These days we regularly use 30 pound wall balls, but with the CrossFit Open coming up, I&rsquo;m guessing 20 pound wall balls will be on the schedule.  </p>
<p><a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4476.jpg"><img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_4476-225x300.jpg" alt="Rep Fitness wall ball" width="225" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5763"></a>What I look for in a wall ball is&hellip;</p>
<p>The texture of the ball (or grip)<br>
The roundness of the ball<br>
The durability of the ball</p>
<h3>The Results/What I Found</h3>
<p>When it comes to the texture of the <a href="http://www.repfitness.com/rep-medicine-wall-balls" title="wall ball" target="_blank">Rep Fitness wall ball</a>, I am impressed.  It&rsquo;s a softer and sticker feeling than most other wall balls I&rsquo;ve used.  </p>
<p>This soft stickiness feels great when you&rsquo;re tired and doing a high number of wall balls.  </p>
<p>One of the worst things that can happen is having a wall ball slip through your hands in the middle of a set.  It can be a &ldquo;soul crusher&rdquo;!  That is very unlikely to happen with the <a href="http://www.repfitness.com/rep-medicine-wall-balls" target="_blank">Rep Fitness wall ball</a>. </p>
<p>Roundness is the second thing on my list of qualities to look for when using a wall ball.  A lot of times wall balls are soft, but the softness sometimes allows for lopsidedness.  And like having a slippery wall ball, a lopsided ball and also cause dropping.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.repfitness.com/rep-medicine-wall-balls" title="wall ball" target="_blank">Rep Fitness wall ball</a> did have a little bit of lopsidedness when it came out of the box.  </p>
<p>What happens is you throw the wall ball up to the 10 foot mark, and when it hits the wall, it bounces in an unexpected way.  This causes you to have to adjust your position which takes energy.</p>
<p>The amount of lopsidedness in the Rep Fitness wall ball isn&rsquo;t a game changer, but it would be nice to have a very round wall ball to increase the consistent results of each throw.</p>
<p>Last on my list of factors to consider when using a wall ball is, durability of the wall ball.</p>
<p>So far, the durability of the Rep Fitness wall ball has been great.  It&rsquo;s only been on our StoneWay CrossFit gym floor for a couple of weeks, but it&rsquo;s not showing any signs of wear whatsoever from our 200+ members.  If this changes I will update this post accordingly.</p>
<h3>Conclusion&hellip;</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering buying a wall ball for your home, or a bunch of them for your gym you, and the feeling of the wall ball is of top concern for you, the Rep Fitness walls balls should be highly considered.  If the roundness and consistency of tossing is your top concern, you might want to look elsewhere.  And I believe that the durability will hold up with the best of them.</p>
