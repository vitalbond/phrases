<div><p>These days you hear about obstacle course races almost daily.</p>
<p>They come in all shapes and sizes.  Short 3 mile events, all the way up to very long and grueling Death Races.  </p>
<p>Some might say that these races can get out of hand, but I truly believe there is a place for them in all of our lives.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544286170/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0544286170&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bauercon-20"><img src="http://allaroundjoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Spartan-Up-Book_300x250.jpg" alt="Spartan-Up-Book_300x250" width="300" height="250" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5785"></a>These races push us to places that we might not have known existed.  We become different people because of the obstacles they make us overcome.</p>
<p>This might sound like I&rsquo;m promoting that you do an obstacle course race (or 10), and I do think that you should, but what I&rsquo;m really writing about here is a book that will be coming out in the following months.</p>
<p>The book is written by Joe DeSena the creator of the Spartan Race, and called Spartan Up. </p>
<p>I just finished reading the synopsis for Spartan Up (<a href="http://spartanupthebook.com/pdf/BookSpartanUpSynopsis.pdf" title="Spartan Up" target="_blank">download here</a>), and am ecstatic about the content.  Joe DeSena speaks to me, and shares my same values.  </p>
<p>He believes in being passionate and working HARD!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instant gratification guides so much of modern-day life. The individual lacking self-control wants things from others now, but they themselves couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to put in the work and get shit done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reminds me of a great quote from the bodybuilder Ronnie Coleman. &ldquo;Everyone wants to be a bodybuilder, but no one wants to lift them heavy ass weights!&rdquo; </p>
<p>We get so involved in what&rsquo;s on Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram that we forget that we aren&rsquo;t having conversations with people that are right in front of us.  Building real relationships.  We aren&rsquo;t doing things that we are actually passionate about, and will help us reach our goals.  </p>
<p>I believe that doing races like the Spartan Race in any distance shocks us to get out of this immediate gratification mindset, and pushes us towards doing things with greater meaning.</p>
<p>And I believe that Joe&rsquo;s book will do the same.  </p>
<p>I will be getting a copy of Spartan Up the day it ships, and if you ever feel like you get caught up in the everyday grind, doing what everyone else is doing, and not necessarily what you really want to be doing, you should order yourself a copy too.  I believe that it will be the kick in the butt motivational, and informational book that we can all use.</p>
