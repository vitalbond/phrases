<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Let’s chat.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12655 size-large" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_5451-550x550.jpg" alt="IMG 5451 550x550 Friday Things" width="550" height="550" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p>Hubby’s surgery went well. They did some cleanup on his rotator cuff and actually ended up also repairing his labrum, which was not part of the original plan, but that’s what he had his surgery on the other shoulder for. SO, hopefully between those two things, now all will be well. The good news is that they didn’t have to do anything to his bicep tendon, which is what we were most worried about.</p>

<p>He didn’t get a nerve block this time, since we had such a bad experience with it last time….so he was in a lot more pain after surgery, which meant we had to stay at the hospital longer while they gave him some IV drugs. But once we finally got home and got him started on his prescription meds, he’s doing much better today and the pain is under control. We head back to see the surgeon in a week and depending on how he’s recovering, he’ll be in the sling for 4-6 weeks. Keep your fingers crossed it’s only 4!</p>

<p>We sold our old couch. A couple months ago we bought a new couch and in a fit of impatience, I posted our old one on Craigslist a bit too early. The buyer ended up falling through, but then we almost waited to long to post it again. We got a call that our new one would be delivered yesterday, but we needed to have the old one out by Tuesday since that’s the last day hubby could help me move it. We didn’t have the same amount of interest when we posted it the second time and I was almost ready to just have a donation center come pick it up, but at the last minute- literally like 8pm Tuesday night, a couple said they would take it and could come get it that night.</p>
<p>So, out with the old and in with the new!</p>

<p>We’re getting a smaller coffee table and a side table to fill that corner so it will look more complete once we have those!</p>

They were designed by a high school student and I absolutely love his mission. More from the website:</p>

<p>Anyone else watching? Hubby and I are so excited Season 2 is here. We didn’t watch right away so we could save for surgery recovery viewing so we started watching last night! (No spoilers)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Random thought:</p>
<p>I wish my belly button didn’t have to pop out. It hasn’t yet, but it’s getting less deep and I know it’s coming. I don’t really have a good reason…just never been a huge fan of outie belly buttons.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Has anyone used one of these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.armsreach.com/shop/co-sleeper_bassinets/cocoon-bassinet" target="_blank">Cocoon Bassinets</a></strong></span>? The couple we bought our glider from was telling us how their son loved it. If not, what did you use when baby was newborn and sleeping in your room?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That’s all for today, friends! Happy weekend.</p>
