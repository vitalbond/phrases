<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Well, the big day is almost here! Monday we have our 20 week appointment and with that comes the gender reveal ultrasound. I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to let you guys get your guesses in first though!</p>
<p>So here we go:</p>
<p></p><center><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12519" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/babyvote.jpg.jpg" alt="babyvote.jpg Baby Bean: Boy or Girl?" width="464" height="295" title="Baby Bean: Boy or Girl?"></center>A few tidbits that may or may not help:
<p>Morning sickness?<br>
Yes. Nauseous all day every day until 17 weeks and then nauseous about 50% of the day for weeks 18 &amp; 19.</p>
<p>Heartburn?<br>
Yes, mainly weeks 17-19.</p>
<p>Weight gain?<br>
It took me until 16 weeks to get back to my starting weight after losing some when I felt sick all day. Since then I&rsquo;ve gained about&nbsp;3 pounds.</p>
<p>Maternity clothes?<br>
Not really. I have one pair of maternity jeans that I wear if I need to wear pants. Otherwise, regular stuff is working. I did buy some shorts that are larges instead of mediums to wear to crossfit just because they&rsquo;re more comfortable&hellip;but they&rsquo;re not maternity. I think they&rsquo;ll be coming soon though. I need to find some tank tops that are more comfortable for both everyday wear and workouts.</p>
<p>Visible bump?<br>
It&rsquo;s visible to me&hellip;and to people who really know what my stomach used to look like. But to others, especially strangers, probably not. Also keep in mind that I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;11 and have a long torso.</p>
<p>Trouble sleeping?<br>
Not really. I usually have to pee 2x at night and sometimes I have trouble falling back to sleep after I get up to feed the dogs around 5:30&hellip;but not much trouble falling asleep yet.</p>
<p>Aches and pains?<br>
Aside from being sore from Crossfit, not really. My lower back and hip bother me occasionally, lower back especially from weeks 6-16, but both of those things also bothered me before I was pregnant&hellip;</p>
<p>Cravings and aversions?<br>
Carrots and avocado are still not sounding great to me. Chipotle and dessert always sound good.</p>
<p>Baby&rsquo;s heart rate?<br>
From what I can remember&hellip;134, 144, 140 BPM at various appointments.</p>
<p>Mood:<br>
Overall pretty good. I had a few emotional breakdowns around weeks 16-17 when I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was ever going to stop feeling nauseous.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to find out!!</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend!<br>
