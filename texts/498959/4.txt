<div>Here&rsquo;s my&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;Food Prep:</div>
<div>Chicken Breasts, Fish, Carrot Sticks, Sausage Egg and Cheese Burritos (I&rsquo;ll freeze them and use when needed) Protein Bars with Peanut Butter, Oats, Vegan Protein Powder, Raisins and Almonds and some Hard Boiled Eggs. &nbsp;Not Pictured: Lettuce for Salads, and Sliced Veggies.</div>

<p>I &nbsp;was craving salads during the week, but needed something I could easily bring to school with me. To save time. I chopped and washed a mix of lettuces and placed them in individual &nbsp;bags for each day. Then I chopped peppers, cherry tomatoes and cucumber. Those went into individual baggies with some drained black beans as well. Now all I have to do is sliced on avocado and toss with dressing!</p>

<div>I washed and cut up celery to have on hand either for snacks or to cook with later (I ended up eating the celery with my lunch everyday). I made my husband some chicken salad so he can just grab it for his lunches either at work or when he&rsquo;s at home (fat free mayo, diced celery, dill relish), and put them in two separate grab-and-go containers. I tried a new cookie recipe for when I get hit with my sweet tooth (<a href="http://foodsforthesoul.net/blog/2014/01/12/blueberry-oatmeal-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blueberry oatmeal cookies</a>). I also tried a protein muffin recipe so I can grab one for a mid-morning snack for work. I changed the recipe from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fitnessrxwomen.com/life-health/jaime-baird/pumpkin-cinnamon-rolls/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pumpkin cinnamon roll protein muffins</a>&nbsp;I found on&nbsp;<a href="http://pinterest.com/mla317" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pinterest</a>. I also pre-made Italian turkey meatballs for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shugarysweets.com/2014/02/meatball-parmesan-casserole" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">meatball casserole</a>. Finally I pulled out some &nbsp;beef veggie soup from the freezer that M&rsquo;s mom had made for us. I&rsquo;ve been taking some for my lunches at work along with a sandwich.</div>

<div>I made some hard boiled eggs for snacking/breakfasts, chopped up some lettuce for a salad at lunch&nbsp;tomorrow. I also roasted the squash to make the enchilada filling and made the sauce for them. Lastly I made a batch of my&nbsp;<a title="Homemade Pizza Dough" href="http://www.saltedplates.com/homemade-pizza-dough/" target="_blank">Whole Wheat Pizza Dough&nbsp;</a>since I was out and will need it&nbsp;on Friday&nbsp;for pizza.</div>
