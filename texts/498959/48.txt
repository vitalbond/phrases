<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Foodie Penpals reveal day. This is actually the first month since I started the program that I didn&rsquo;t participate. What can I say? Everyone needs a break every once and a while.</p>
<p>But, I still wanted to give you guys the info in case you want to join for next month!</p>
