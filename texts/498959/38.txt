<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for more food prep inspiration! Here&rsquo;s what I prepped last week:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12134 size-large" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_4392-550x550.jpg" alt="IMG 4392 550x550 Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 61" width="550" height="550" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 61"></p>
<p>I made:</p>
<ul><li>Quinoa Breakfast Bars</li>
<li>Sweet Potato Soup</li>
<li>Sweet Potato Bites</li>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Pork Tenderloin</li>
<li>Chicken</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Salmon</li>
<li>Beans</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Brown Rice</li>
</ul><p>Here&rsquo;s what you guys have been up to:</p>
<p>Allie-</p>
<p>Shredded chicken in the crockpot for chicken salad and enchiladas. Hard boiled eggs for snacks. Overnight oats for breakfast on the go. Salads w broccoli slaw, mixed greens, craisins, chickpeas, tomatoes and mushrooms- lunch all week! Not pictured &ndash; apples, bananas and pre-portioned bags of grapes and blueberries. I workout in the morning so it&rsquo;s important for me to have breakfast and lunch ready to go so I can grab them before heading to the gym and then straight to work!</p>

<div>&bull; Salads &amp; Dressing</div>
<div>&bull; Toasted walnuts &amp; pecans</div>
<div>&bull; Spiralized veggies</div>
<div>&bull; Ghee (clarified butter)</div>
<div>&bull; Roasted beets</div>
<div>&bull; Okra &amp; Tomatoes</div>
<div>&bull; Cauliflower Rice</div>
<div>&bull; Roasted Garlic</div>
<div></div>
<div>I typically like to prep all my veggies&nbsp;on Sunday, as I find it makes putting meals together during the week much easier! This way there is no excuse not to eat them everyday! This week I made a couple of salads to accompany lunches and also toasted some nuts for toppings. I made a quick salad dressing with avocado oil and raspberry balsamic. I also made a batch of ghee (clarified butter), which is great for roasting vegetables. Okra and tomatoes are a great dish served on top of the cauliflower rice. Cauliflower rice is easy to make in the food processor and can be served with a variety of dishes. Beets will be used as a side dish and sprinkled with goat cheese and balsamic. The spiralized zucchinis will be served with a meat sauce for a quick dinner. I will be using the spiralized sweet potatoes to make a red curry from the <a href="http://blog.williams-sonoma.com/get-inspiralized-meet-blogger-ali-maffucci/" target="_blank">Inspiralized Blog</a>. Finally, I love roasting the cloves from a whole head of garlic to keep in the fridge. I have been known to eat entire cloves, but they are also a great addition to chicken dishes, salads, or pastas!</div>

<div>&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a brief description of what I did for my meal prep:
<ul><li>Protein- chicken or tilapia. I seasoned all the chicken differently to keep it interesting.</li>
<li>With 2 of these sides:</li>
<li>Sweet potato, brown rice, zucchini and spinach with chickpeas saut&eacute;ed in garlic and lemon juice, lightly salted oven roasted carrots, or quinoa with black beans.</li>
</ul><p>Not bad for my first attempt, eh?</p>
<div>
<p>It only took about 2 hours total, dish washing &amp; all. Now I don&rsquo;t have to cook for the rest of the week! That makes this busy grad student very happy.</p>
