<p>Time for some Friday rambles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This was in Hawaii 2 years ago.<br>
I wish we were back there.</p>
<p>First things first: my parents are in town! It&rsquo;s been a while since they&rsquo;ve been here so they&nbsp;haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of the house updates hubby has done. We don&rsquo;t have much planned except some baby bean celebrations and a little shopping.</p>

<p>Speaking of house updates&hellip;.there are some that we need done that are just not fun. Our chimney needs to be repaired&hellip;we need a new deck&hellip;we need new windows&hellip;our driveway needs to be repaired. All super boring stuff that just costs a lot of money. Booooooo.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From my best friend. So adorable.</p>
<p>So we will hit the 15 week mark this weekend. I&rsquo;m getting excited for our 16 week appointment because I&rsquo;m kinda neurotic and like to know that everything is going well with baby bean. Having to wait a month between appointments is hard for me. I&rsquo;m still feeling sick&hellip;but (cross your fingers) I feel like maybe things are getting a little bit better. I&rsquo;m hopeful that sometime in the next week or two I&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I think pregnancy is giving me weird dreams. I have been having THE WEIRDEST dreams lately. Every single time I fall asleep. Some are scary&hellip;some are just bizarre.</p>

<p>On Wednesday we had someone come over to spray for bugs. When he left, he left the gate to our fence wide open. Consequently, these two went out on a little joy run. Let me tell you, there is nothing scarier than going to let the dogs inside and finding an empty backyard&hellip;.especially since we live quite close to a very busy intersection. Luckily they came running back, just happy as can be, after I called them for about 5 minutes&hellip;but still scary.</p>

<p>On the cat front&hellip;this guy has been throwing up EVERYWHERE. He gets bad hairballs and it&rsquo;s annoying. However, I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say that sometimes I just let Abner eat the puke. Gross&hellip;.but he likes gross things and it&rsquo;s less mess to clean up. Tell me I&rsquo;m not alone here?</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, hubby &amp; I bought a new couch and loveseat for our family room. Last week, when we were getting ready for the garage sale, I went a little crazy wanting to clear stuff out. We were listing some of our bigger furniture items on Craigslist and I went ahead and listed the couch. It sold in 15 minutes. Our new couches don&rsquo;t come until the first week of June.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I was thinking. In any event, we were fully prepared to just pull a couple of chairs into our family room for the next 6 weeks, but then the people who wanted the couch ended up not being able to come get it last weekend because the wife got sick. So, the couch is still here&hellip;which is good, because now my parents have somewhere to sit&hellip;We&rsquo;re not sure if they buyers still want it or not&hellip;but if we don&rsquo;t hear from them, we&rsquo;ll just re-list it towards the end of May and we&rsquo;re sure it will sell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&rsquo;s about all I can think of right now. Tell me something random from your life lately!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enjoy!<br>
