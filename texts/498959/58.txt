<div style="color: #222222;">This week I washed, peeled, and cut up beets to freeze and use in smoothies or juices this week. I also prepped some berries to use in plain greek yogurt. I made banana muffins for breakfast or snacks, and black bean brownies as a sweet treat. I knew I would be eating a lot of chicken this week, so cut it into the sizes I needed for each meal and froze it in separate labeled bags. I made hummus to snack on with carrots. Finally, I prepped part of my dinners including a sauce for an orange chicken dish, veggies for roasting, quinoa, and veggies to use in a pasta dish. Most of these dishes have links to the recipe in my blog post&nbsp;<a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://runningoutofwine.com/2014/04/27/meal-planning-and-changes-to-the-blog/" target="_blank">HERE</a></div>
