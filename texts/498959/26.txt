<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for more food prep inspiration!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8680" alt="sundayfoodprep Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 59" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sundayfoodprep.jpg" width="640" height="640" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 59"></p>
<p>Like I mentioned, I didn&rsquo;t have time to prep last weekend. Instead I shared <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/10-foods-that-freeze-well/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>10 Foods That Freeze Well</strong> </span></a>that can help you out on busy weeks when you just can&rsquo;t find time to prep!</p>
<p>Lucky for me, though, you guys are on top of your game&hellip;so here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve been up to in the kitchen:</p>

<p>Every Sunday I prep my lunches and snacks for the week. This week I made salads (lettuce, chicken breast, quinoa, sweet potato, bell pepper, green onions, feta), a turkey breast sandwich, and celery, carrots, apples and string cheese for snacks.</p>

<div>This week&rsquo;s food prep was all about maximizing my time in the kitchen. I wanted to take advantage of the nice weather outside and spending time with friends and family, so it was all about multitasking!</div>

<p>In total, I probably spent an hour actively prepping food for the week.</p>
<p>If you are interested in food prepping, I recommend going in with a plan and making it easy for yourself. Start small with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/563724078329312636/" target="_blank">a few basics</a>&nbsp;that you know will help make your week easier!</p>

<p>Sundays are busy days at our house. J &nbsp;cleans (could I be any luckier?!) while I cook up a storm in the kitchen. During rotations I just don&rsquo;t have time to cook during the week. And if I do have time, I really don&rsquo;t want to slave away in the kitchen after a 10-12 hour day. Here is an example of what we eat for the week:</p>
<p>Back Left&nbsp;&ndash; Salads</p>
<ul><li>Fresh lettuce washed and chopped, ready to eat</li>
<li>Celery sticks, washed and trimmed</li>
<li>Cucumbers and Tomatoes, washed and diced, ready for salads</li>
</ul><p>Front Left&nbsp;&ndash; snacks</p>
<ul><li><a title="Banana Oat Muffins" href="http://nutritionhealthlife.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/banana-oat-muffins/" target="_blank">Banana Oat Muffins</a></li>
<li>Mixed nuts (low salt), 1/4 cup portions in individual baggies</li>
</ul><p>Center&nbsp;- Breakfast and Lunch</p>
<ul><li>Roasted mixed vegetables with wheat pasta and balsamic vinegar. Roasted veggies are so easy &ndash; just throw them in a large pan, toss with olive oil and spices, and roast at 425F for 30 minutes stirring every 10 minutes or so to prevent burning.</li>
<li><a title="CSA Veggie Egg Bake" href="http://nutritionhealthlife.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/csa-veggie-egg-bake/" target="_blank">Egg Bakes</a>&nbsp;- the easiest way to get a vegetable serving in before 7am</li>
</ul><p>Back Right&nbsp;&ndash; Dinner</p>
<ul><li><a title="Turkey Chili" href="http://nutritionhealthlife.wordpress.com/2008/11/20/turkey-chili/" target="_blank">Crock pot chili</a>, half for this week and for the freezer for a week when I don&rsquo;t want to cook&nbsp;<img alt=" Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 59" src="http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?m=1129645325g" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 59"></li>
</ul><p>Front Right&nbsp;&ndash; Dessert</p>
<ul><li><a title="Black Bean Brownies to Die For" href="http://nutritionhealthlife.wordpress.com/2014/02/23/black-bean-brownies-to-die-for/" target="_blank">Black bean brownies</a>, because pregnant women love chocolate and desserts&hellip;and since I&rsquo;m a dietitian I will feel less guilty if I know they are full of nutritious black beans.</li>

<ul><li>Green Smoothie Bags for the freezer (inspiration from Sally @ Real Mom Nutrition) &ndash; pineapple, peaches, bananas &amp; spinach</li>
<li>Roasted Pork Tenderloin</li>
<li>White Bean Salad (I&rsquo;ve started building my salads in reverse to keep the dressing and &ldquo;wilting&rdquo; ingredients on the bottom. Keeps the salad fresher and puts all the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; on top when inverted into salad bowl later)</li>
<li>Salad in a jar (also built in reverse) &ndash; these are greens, black beans, cherry tomatoes, pineapple and a dressing made of canola oil, lime juice, crushed chipotle peppers and ground cumin</li>
<li>Sauteed chicken tenders</li>
<li>Roasted Veggie Lasagna &ndash; made with roasted red, yellow &amp; orange bell peppers, roasted asparagus, whole grain lasagna noodles and filling of cottage cheese, beaten eggs and whey powder, topped with mozzarella and Parmesan</li>
