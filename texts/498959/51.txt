<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Totally random post today. I noticed something was annoying me the other day and for some reason it got me thinking. It was a little thing&hellip;something that most people probably wouldn&rsquo;t even notice&hellip;but it was driving me crazy. I thought it might be fun to make a list of other such things that annoy me. Perhaps some of you can relate to them.</p>
<p>I was originally going to title this post &ldquo;Things I Hate&rdquo;&hellip;but hate is a strong word&hellip;and that&rsquo;s not really what these are. Just funny little things that drive me crazy, just because I&rsquo;m me!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">{I imagine Marcus finds it annoying when he just can&rsquo;t get his head<br>
quite far enough into the glass to get the milk he wants}</p>
<p>So here we go:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Seeing the alarm symbol in the corner of my phone.</strong></span> I&rsquo;m not one of those people who can leave their alarm set all day every day. Seeing that little symbol drives me crazy. I set it right before I go to bed and turn it off right when I get up. Side note- I also have to set my alarm for a time that ends in a 0 or 5. None of this waking up at 7:23 business for me. 7:20 or 7:25 please.</p>
<p><strong>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listening to people chew.</span></strong> Can.NOT.stand.it. The sound of other people chewing drives me crazy/makes me want to cover my ears and run away screaming.</p>
<p><strong>3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pimples that haven&rsquo;t been popped.</span></strong> I know it goes against everything they tell you&hellip;but I HAVE to pop my pimples. I can&rsquo;t stand seeing those little whiteheads on my face that haven&rsquo;t been popped.</p>
<p><strong>4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Having a full inbox</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> This one is a constant struggle&hellip;but having a full inbox drives me crazy. Although I almost never get to empty anymore&hellip;I do my best to keep the number of emails in my inbox low. Coming&nbsp;back to my computer after a weekend of ignoring emails&hellip;cue mini panic attack until I get it under control.</p>
<p><strong>5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">People saying they can&rsquo;t find something..</span>.</strong>when they haven&rsquo;t even really looked. My husband, to a T.<br>
Him- &ldquo;Where are the chips?&rdquo;<br>
Me- &ldquo;In the pantry.&rdquo;<br>
Him- Cursory 5 second look around the pantry and then &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find them.&rdquo;<br>
Me- Walk to the pantry and pull them out 3 seconds later. &nbsp;Sigh.</p>
<p><strong>6) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drinking water without ice.</span></strong> No thank you. I love cold water&hellip;room temp grosses me out. Plus I love chewing on ice.</p>
<p><strong>7) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wearing shoes&hellip;or socks&hellip;.</span></strong>or when the blankets are tucked into the end of the bed too tightly and I can&rsquo;t get my feet out. Drives me nuts! My feet need to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>8) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pants that are too short</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> Story of my 5&rsquo;11 life&hellip;but really. There is nothing worse than finding a pair of pants you love, trying them on and having them look like high-waters.</p>
<p><strong>9) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choosing paint colors.</span></strong> Have you done this lately? It is THE WORST. The color on the wall never looks anything like the paint chip&hellip;and there are just too many to choose from!</p>
<p><strong>10)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Facebook app on my phone.</span></strong> It shows me three posts, and then I scroll down and it literally shows me the exact three same posts again. Stop wasting my time that I&rsquo;m already wasting!</p>
<p><strong>11) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bad lighting..</span>.</strong>Like when your pet is doing something adorable&hellip;and it&rsquo;s too dark to take a good picture. Or they look really cute, you take a picture&hellip;and then they just look grumpy and angry in the pic.</p>
<p><strong>12) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Getting nothing but junk in the mail.</span></strong> I&rsquo;ve always loved getting the mail&hellip;but now it seems like all we get is junk. Makes it not even worth walking to the mailbox! Send me some good snail mail!</p>
<p><strong>13) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-athletic shorts</span>.</strong> Ugh. Give me a pair of lightweight leggings, a long skirt or a maxi dress over a pair of regular shorts any day.</p>
<p><strong>14) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Slideshow articles.</span>&nbsp;</strong>You know the kind. You see an article headline online that sounds really interesting&hellip;and then it&rsquo;s one of those where you have to click through a million pages of a slide show to see the whole thing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Just put it all on one page please!</p>
<p><strong>15) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Slow walkers.</span></strong> Hubby and I have long legs. We walk fast. Getting stuck behind a slow walker on the sidewalk/stairs/grocery store aisle, etc. is excruciatingly painful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
