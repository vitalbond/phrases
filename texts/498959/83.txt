<p>Like I mentioned in a previous post, my nausea has returned after a couple week break. Yesterday was a particularly bad day. It&rsquo;s tough, but I&rsquo;m taking it one day at a time. Breakfast has been giving me trouble, which sucks because it&rsquo;s my favorite meal of the day. I&rsquo;ve been sticking with Cheerios mostly since my beloved oatmeal isn&rsquo;t going down so well&hellip;.but hopefully it will be back soon!</p>
<p>Still doing my best to eat balanced meals, get adequate protein and get veggies in whenever I can!</p>
