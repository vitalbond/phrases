<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got another wonderful guest post for you guys today. Kylie from <a href="http://immaeatthat.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yeah&hellip;Imma Eat That</strong></span></a> is here to share a delicious Easter (or any time really&hellip;) dessert recipe with you. I fell in love with Kylie&rsquo;s blog last year. All her recipes make me drool&hellip;she&rsquo;s witty and hilarious&hellip;and I even got to meet her in person last Fall at FNCE. She&rsquo;s on her way to becoming a Registered Dietitian! If you haven&rsquo;t checked out her blog, go add it to your reader immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled(!!) to be here sharing a post on The Lean Green Bean.&nbsp; Last October, I got to meet and go to dinner with Lindsay during FNCE.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s great.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve never met her husband, but according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/you-might-be-married-to-a-dietitian-if/">this list of oh-so-true things</a></strong></span>&hellip;I have to believe he&rsquo;s great too.</p>
<p>So Easter is just around the corner.&nbsp; The only time of year where my fascination for pastel clothing is appropriate.&nbsp; Dear Mint-colored denim pants, I want to wear you everyday!&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t&hellip;why isn&rsquo;t denim considered business casual?&nbsp; If I had a business, wearing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/317574211194087698/">colored denim</a></strong></span> would be encouraged.&nbsp; The only problem is light colored clothing is so hard to keep clean.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t try to eat some juicy raspberries with those pants on&hellip;you will lose.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are some foods that are safe to eat in pastel colored pants, like cream cheese frosting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s already white&hellip;so any stain you get on your pants will be barely noticeable.</p>

<p>The good thing about being an adult and whatnot is that you get to pick out your own Easter outfit.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember an Easter of Easters Past when my mom made me wear this horrible watermelon jumper outfit.&nbsp; I threw such a fit that I wasn&rsquo;t even allowed to hunt Easter eggs.&nbsp; Worst.Easter.Ever.&nbsp; Little did I know that you have to trade being able to pick out your own clothes for being your own Easter Bunny.</p>
<p>So about these carrot cake bars, I&rsquo;m a hopeless romantic for doughy things.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only met one person who doesn&rsquo;t like cookie dough&hellip;and then I married that person.&nbsp; In my husbands&rsquo; words, &ldquo;cookie dough is like a cold ball of sand.&rdquo;&nbsp; I assure you that he has plenty of redeeming qualities.</p>
<p>The point of the cookie dough discussion is that the bottom layer of these bars is doughy and sweet, kinda like cookie dough.&nbsp; Then you top that doughy layer with a fluffy cream cheese frosting of sorts.&nbsp; For me, Easter brings up thoughts of carrot cake things and coconut truffles.&nbsp; So these bars are those things smooshed together.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Easter in a bar.&nbsp; If only they were more pastel-y.</p>

<p><b>No-Bake Carrot Cake Cream Cheese Bars<br></b><i>Makes 9 bars</i></p>
<p><b>Bottom Layer</b></p>
<ul><li>&frac12; cup walnuts</li>
<li>&frac12; cup almonds</li>
<li>1 cup dates, pitted (~20 dates)</li>
<li>&frac14; teaspoon sea salt</li>
<li>&frac12; cup carrots, grated</li>
</ul><p><b>Frosting</b></p>
<ul><li>&frac12; cup 2% greek yogurt, plain</li>
<li>2 ounces cream cheese</li>
<li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul><p><b>Topping</b></p>
<ul><li>2 tablespoons coconut, shredded &amp; unsweetened (optional)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<p>1. Place walnuts and almonds into a saut&eacute; pan over medium-high heat.&nbsp; Constantly stir for ~5 minutes, or until nuts are slightly toasted (be careful not to let them burn).<br>
2. Into a food processor, add toasted nuts, sea salt and dates.&nbsp; Process until the mixture forms a dough.<br>
3. Place grated carrots into a couple paper towels and squeeze the excess moisture out of the carrots.<br>
4. Dump the shredded/squeezed carrots and the dough into a bowl and combine.&nbsp; Press dough into a parchment paper lined 8&times;8-inch dish.<br>
5. Now make your frosting.&nbsp; In a bowl, use an electric mixer to combine greek yogurt, cream cheese, maple syrup and vanilla.&nbsp; Mix on high speed until smooth.<br>
6. Spread frosting over pressed out dough.&nbsp; Sprinkle with coconut.&nbsp; Allow bars to set in the fridge for at least 1 hour before slicing into 9 bars.</p>
<p><b>P.S.</b> If you have a coconut hater in your life (like I do), you can just leave the coconut flakes off.</p>
