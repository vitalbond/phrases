<p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for another delicious roundup! Let&rsquo;s talk salads. When most people hear the word salad, they typically think regular old lettuce, topped with a few veggies and some dressing. My husband eats a bowl of green leaf lettuce topped with broccoli and cucumbers for lunch pretty much every single day. That&rsquo;s all well and good&hellip;but for me personally, I&rsquo;m not really crazy about regular lettuce.&nbsp;GASP! I know. Luckily though, the word &ldquo;salad&rdquo; has evolved and expanded&nbsp;its meaning and there are all sorts of interesting combinations that can now be considered salad!</p>
<p>Next week, I&rsquo;ll share a delicious Salmon Chop Salad I came up with a few days ago that&rsquo;s packed with veggies but totally free of lettuce!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I scoured the&nbsp;post history of some of my favorite blogs in my Feedly and put together a collection of 15 Non-Traditional Salads for you to check out. Everything from kale salads, to pasta salads, to meat salads.</p>
<p>Click the collection below to check&nbsp;them out for some spring and summer inspiration!</p>
