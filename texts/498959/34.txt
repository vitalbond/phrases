<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Today is my 29th birthday! If you need me, i&rsquo;ll be busy pretending that this past weekend&rsquo;s weather (70 and sunny) was meant for my bday&hellip;since Mother Nature has decided it should only be 38 degrees today. WHAT?!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also be eating my last little birthday ice cream cupcake and treating myself to a nap!</p>

<p>When I was younger, the only &ldquo;birthday cake&rdquo; I ever requested was actually more like an ice cream pie. It was an oreo crust filled with strawberry ice cream and topped with m&amp;ms. I found this pic from one of my earlier bdays to show you one my mom made:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been forever since I had my favorite cake&hellip;.so this year I decided to treat myself. I made little individual ice cream cupcakes because they&rsquo;re easier to deal with&hellip;the big pie can be hard to cut and this way they&rsquo;re already pre-portioned. All you have to do is mix together some crushed oreos and a little melted butter and press into the bottoms of the muffin tins, top with strawberry ice cream and then add a few m&amp;ms and store in the freezer. I think I made 8 of them so I&rsquo;ve been enjoying them for dessert for the past week and a half! Delish.</p>
