<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Need a little Sunday food prep inspiration?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8543 size-full" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sundayfoodprep21-e1399052748739.jpg" alt="sundayfoodprep21 e1399052748739 Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 63" width="550" height="550" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 63"></p>
<p>Like I mentioned a few times this week, I didn&rsquo;t get around to food prep last weekend. I was enjoying time with my parents and then recovering from a whirlwind weekend after they left. Here&rsquo;s how we made it work for the week:</p>
<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sunday</strong></span> we ate leftovers from our Saturday night dinner- we had a cookout with my parents over at my in-laws. It was fun to get everyone together. Hubby grilled steaks for his parents and my mom, and bbq chicken for my dad and I.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Monday</strong></span> I made <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/pineapple-chicken-with-bok-choy/" target="_blank"><span><strong>Pineapple Chicken with Bok Choy</strong></span></a> using 2&nbsp;of the extra chicken breasts that we didn&rsquo;t grill (we bought a large pack of chicken at Costco while we were getting the steaks there&hellip;but only cooked 2 chicken breasts on Saturday).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tuesday</strong></span> we treated ourselves to Chipotle after a late night of choosing paint colors for the nursery.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wednesday</strong></span> I made a lasagna with some ground beef that I pulled out of the freezer on Monday morning. We stopped at the store to get beer for hubby on Tuesday night, so I grabbed a carton of ricotta cheese which was the only thing I didn&rsquo;t have on hand + a head of lettuce for salad. I used the beef and veggies from the freezer and tomatoes/onions/garlic/noodles from the pantry.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thursday</strong></span> I made chicken nuggets with the last two chicken breasts and some panko breadcrumbs and served them with a side of mac and cheese and some beans/salad.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friday</strong></span> is our typical out to dinner night.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Saturday</strong></span>- grocery shopping day!</li>
<li>For lunches we scrounged around and used up what was still in the fridge- egg sandwiches, pb&amp;j with cottage cheese, leftovers from dinner Monday, &nbsp;a quick tuna salad using a couple cans of tuna, some leftover guac from Chipotle and some salsa from the fridge and at it with chips, etc.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>So, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be back on track with the food prep today but for now, here&rsquo;s what some of you were up to last weekend:</p>

<div style="color: #222222;">I am always on top of my food shopping but don&rsquo;t prepare meals in advance as I like to decide each day what we will eat based upon what we are in the mood for. That being said, I do ensure to have some&nbsp;things ready, organized and easily accessible to throw together&nbsp;when we are hungry and especially in&nbsp;between afterschool activities.</div>
<div style="color: #222222;"></div>
<div style="color: #222222;">Last week&rsquo;s&nbsp;minimal food&nbsp;prep:</div>
<div style="color: #222222;"></div>
<div>
<ul><li style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;">Washed and chopped fresh broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">Diced up a giant watermelon to easily have ready for snacks</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">I always cook a pot of oatmeal in order to have individual bowls ready to eat throughout the week. I vary the oat combination each week to keep things interesting. This pot was steel-cut oats mixed with old-fashioned rolled oats, oat bran, chia seeds and blueberries.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">Oat bran breaded and baked chicken cutlets to use a variety of ways for my son during week; as chicken fingers with dipping sauce, baked with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese or eaten cold in a salad.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #222222;">Rather than cook my own brown rice, I make sure my freezer is prepared with individual servings of Trader Joe&rsquo;s Rice Medley which heats up in three minutes and leftovers easily store in the refrigerator!</span></li>
</ul></div>

I recently started working at a new job with a regular schedule, so a little weekend food prepping is making things a lot easier! Here&rsquo;s one Sunday spread:</div>
<ul><li>A batch of whole-grain <a title="Morning Glory Muffins" href="http://flavorrd.com/2014/04/morning-glory-muffins/">morning glory muffins</a>, for breakfasts and to share at work</li>
<li>A few deviled eggs, to include for protein in lunches as a change of pace from regular hard-boiled</li>
<li>A jar of <a title="Banana Jam" href="http://flavorrd.com/2014/03/banana-jam/">banana jam</a>, to use up a pair of bananas that were getting overripe. I actually ended up giving the jar away to a friend who visited for dinner. Share the goodness!</li>
<li>A huge bowl of cubed watermelon, for snacking and packing with lunch</li>
<li>Two containers of pressure-cooked black beans to freeze for upcoming dinners. There was a third, but we ate it before taking the photo.</li>
<li>A gluten-free <a title="Polenta-Crusted Asparagus and Feta Quiche (Gluten-Free!)" href="http://flavorrd.com/2014/04/polenta-asparagus-feta-quiche/">asparagus/feta quiche with polenta crust</a>. Yum! We ate this for dinner one night with a big green salad, and then I packed slices in my lunch the rest of the week.</li>
<li>A bag of washed spinach ready to go for salads.</li>
