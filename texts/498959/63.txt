<p>1. Long weekend stroll with the pups in the sunshine.<br>
2. Karen- I have a love/hate relationship with Karen. Finished in 7:55 Rx, which is actually only about 30 seconds slower than my last PR so I was pretty happy with that!<br>

<p>1.&nbsp;<span style="color: #222222;">18 min alternating EMOTM pull-ups &amp; overhead squats&hellip; Then The Chief. I used 65# instead of 95# and got 4+9, 4+3, 4+3, 4+3, 4+7<br>
2. Holy legs! 12:26 with 55# and stepups<br>
3. I take the boys on a walk pretty much every afternoon.<br>
4. 10 rounds with a 35# kettlebell. I think the class was doing handstand pushups but I subbed goblet squats for those.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>1. Did this one by myself and it was a r<span style="color: #222222;" data-reactid=".r[j].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[1].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[2][1].[0]">ough one. I used a 30</span><span style="color: #222222;" data-reactid=".r[j].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[1].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[2][1].[1]">#db (Rx was 35#)</span><span style="color: #222222;" data-reactid=".r[j].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[1].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[2][1].[2]">&nbsp;and a 14# wall ball.<br>
2. I did 65# clean and jerks instead of 75# and subbed pull-ups for TTB because TTB are uncomfortable for me. 78 reps<br>
3. Made it to my first Saturday morning class in months! Start each round where you ended the last one. I did push-ups instead of knees to elbow and finished just over 8 rounds.</span></p>

2. First time doing Helen in a year. PR&rsquo;d my time by 90 seconds!! 12:05 Rx then, 10:26 Rx this time!<br>
3. This week has been full of rainy nights and sunny days so thy boys and I have still been able to get our walks!<br>
4. Yesterday&rsquo;s wod. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Overall, working out is going well. As you can see, I&rsquo;m still doing pretty much everything&hellip;just with lighter weights. A few things I&rsquo;m not doing &ndash; handstand pushups &ndash; but I didn&rsquo;t do those before because they hurt my neck, toes to bar &ndash; i technically could still be doing these, I just find them to be very uncomfortable so I&rsquo;m not doing them, situps or anything on the GHD, bench press or anything that involves me lying flat on my back. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Some days I struggle with using lighter weights. I&rsquo;m a competitive person and when I see the Rx weights on the board, I want to do them. I miss setting strength PRs and sometimes using 65# feels like such a joke. But I know it&rsquo;s not forever and it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best for me right now. Other days, I&rsquo;m so tired and I can definitely tell I&rsquo;ve lost some of my strength. I&rsquo;ll try to do something with 65# and it just feels so darn heavy, so I&rsquo;ll go down to 55#. It varies day to day and I just take it one day at a time depending on how I feel. If the class is doing a movement I can&rsquo;t do, I just sub in something else. I&rsquo;m definitely still working up a sweat and getting in great workouts, but I&rsquo;m also taking more breaks, making sure my breathing doesn&rsquo;t get out of control, drinking more water, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Mostly I&rsquo;m just thankful that I feel well enough to workout and that I&rsquo;m able to workout when I want to. In the first trimester I focused on getting to crossfit 3 days a week and I absolutely needed a rest day between each workout. I wasn&rsquo;t eating all that much because I was so nauseous and the foods I was eating weren&rsquo;t the best for recovery. I could definitely tell that my muscles were not recovering the way they used to. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Now that I&rsquo;m well into the second trimester and my nausea is FINALLY starting to lessen, I&rsquo;m eating more and can definitely tell I have more energy. I&rsquo;ve even felt good enough to go crossfit 2 days in a row a couple of weeks, but I can definitely tell by day 3 that I need to rest&hellip;.so my goal is still to crossfit 3-4 days per week and then I walk the dogs about 2 miles per day. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">So far that routine is working well for me, so I&rsquo;m sticking to it! Other things that will change as the belly starts to grow- I&rsquo;ll probably start doing straight-arm burpees within the next couple of weeks so my belly isn&rsquo;t hitting the ground, and when it becomes necessary, I&rsquo;ll start doing my pushups with my hands on plates to give the belly a little more room. However, right now, it&rsquo;s not really sticking out all that far so there aren&rsquo;t a ton of things I need to modify at this point. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">I think that&rsquo;s all for today!<br>
Happy Friday!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Enjoy!<br>
