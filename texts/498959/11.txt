<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for some more food prep inspiration. I didn&rsquo;t actually do any prep last weekend. Hubby was out of town from Sunday morning to Wednesday night and I&rsquo;m somewhat embarrassed to admit that our fridge looked like this from last saturday until yesterday afternoon- slim pickins&hellip;but it did give me a good excuse to give it a deep clean, which is desperately needed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11947" alt="photo 94 Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 57" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-94.jpg" width="478" height="640" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 57"></p>
<p>I relied on the freezer and pantry, making things like tuna casserole while he was gone&hellip;but i did swing by the store on Tuesday and pick up a few things so I could make a lasagna for him to eat when he got home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back on track this week, did our grocery shopping yesterday and hopefully I&rsquo;ll get in some food prep later today&hellip;although hubby is in the middle of painting our kitchen which makes it a bit challenging.</p>
<p>Anyways, I still have some inspiration to share because you, the readers, are rocking the food prep! Check it out:</p>

<div>Since I have&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;off I spent&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;doing some leisurely&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;food prep! Usually I prep a few things and kind of go with the flow during the week. But I had the house to myself and the&nbsp;Monday-workday pressure off.&nbsp; So I got to work!</div>
<div>I started by baking some chicken breast tenders and microwaving a spaghetti squash. (FYI the microwave method is&nbsp;<b>so&nbsp;</b>much faster and easier than roasting it in the oven!) Once the spaghetti squash was cooled and strands removed, I mixed it with some veggies, salsa and cilantro and made a makeshift but healthy Mexican casserole! Easily portioned for workday lunches.&nbsp; Just add fresh avocado and you have perfection!</div>
<div>Here is the rest:<br>
-chopped peppers to add to salads,<br>
-more baked chicken tenders<br>
-quinoa and rice to make quick throw-together meals for the bf after his 12+ hour workdays<br>
-roasted sweet potatoes,<br>
-a ton of the bf&rsquo;s favorite protein balls for healthy workday snacks, and<br>
-gluten-free blueberry crumble bars for desserts!All together it only took me about&nbsp;2:30&nbsp;hours! And that was at a leisurely pace!</div>
<div>The protein balls are a cinch to make!&nbsp; Just combine 3/4 cup oats with 1/2 cup protein powder of choice, 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup natural peanut butter, mix and shape into tablespoon-sized balls. Refrigerate and grab and go during the week!</div>

<div>I roasted chicken breasts, sweet potatoes, then a slew of chopped veggies (eggplant, mushrooms, yellow peppers, and zucchini) and put them all in containers for healthier lunches for my boyfriend and myself. I&rsquo;m trying to get him away from eating processed lunch meat and he&rsquo;s excited for his lunches now!</div>
<div></div>
<div>I also made your quinoa breakfast bars (holy yum!) and some protein cookies for healthier sweet snacks throughout the week. &nbsp;Loved prepping and having all of this done. Can&rsquo;t wait to do more next weekend!</div>

<div>I made:</div>
<p>&ndash; curried meatballs</p>
</div>
<p>&ndash; cajun hamburger patties</p>
</div>
<p>&ndash; baked chicken breasts (morroccan seasoned and plain)</p>
</div>
<p>&ndash; hard boiled eggs</p>
</div>
<p>&ndash; cilantro pesto</p>
</div>
<p>&ndash; chopped bell peppers</p>
</div>
<p>&ndash; cauliflower fried rice</p>
<p>I typically don&rsquo;t prep many vegetables for the week because I prefer to cook them the same day I eat them, so my food prep focuses largely on protein sources that are easy to grab and go! Meatballs and hamburger patties are my husband&rsquo;s favorite go-to items for work, and I love to slice up the chicken breasts to eat on salads, serve with cauliflower rice or roasted vegetables, or diced to make chicken salad.</p>
</div>
<div>Hard boiled eggs are great for easy breakfasts or a quick snack at work or post-workout.</div>
<div></div>
<p>The pesto, rice, and diced peppers were the result of having too much produce on hand &ndash; but they&rsquo;ll easily get used up for staple meals like omelets and stir-fry.</p>

<div>&ldquo;This week I prepped: lettuce for salads, cucumbers, hard boiled eggs for breakfast, shredded iceberg for tacos, roasted red peppers, sour cream ranch dip for with raw carrots and broccoli, homemade Spanish rice (delish! recipe is up on the blog), seasoned ground beef for tacos, black beans, and finally a whole chicken that I slow cooked in the crock pot with BBQ sauce, brown sugar, red pepper flakes and garlic. I used that to make pulled BBQ chicken sandwiches for lunch for us this week!&rdquo;</div>

<div>Here&rsquo;s the prep I did today. There&rsquo;s only two of us, and this will keep us going through the week for breakfasts, lunches &amp; light dinners. I have some freezer meals for more substantial meals to use.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul><li>brown bread (some didn&rsquo;t make it past&nbsp;Sunday!) which will make sandwiches for lunch with cheese/PB/etc</li>
<li>granola from <a href="http://www.3191milesapart.com/?p=1604" target="_blank">this recipe</a><a href="http://www.3191milesapart.com/?p=1604" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<wbr></wbr>which will be for breakfasts with some natural yoghurt and maybe some added seeds or fruit.</li>
<li>rice, roasted veggies &amp; fava beans ready for burritos <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-makeahead-roasted-vegetable-burritos-recipes-from-the-kitchn-200281" target="_blank">using this as inspiration</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how they work as a make ahead option. I&rsquo;m planning to try them as lunch as well as a light dinner.</li>
</ul></div>
<div>I&rsquo;ve also bought a lot of fruit (not pictured) to serve as healthy snacks throughout the week.</div>
