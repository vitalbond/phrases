<p>1. Almonds freshly picked off the tree that morning from a local farmer!<br>
2. I may have filled up on breakfast and lunch and not left enough room for all my lunch so I had to make a snack before dinner. Thankfully I packed healthy snacks so I ate some tuna with avocado and a nectarine!</p>

</ul><p>Enjoy!<br>
