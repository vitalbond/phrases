<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for more food prep inspiration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-11989" alt="IMG 3961 Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 58" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3961.jpg" width="550" height="550" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 58"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&rsquo;s what I prepped last weekend:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/quinoa-breakfast-bars/" target="_blank">Quinoa breakfast bars</a></li>
<li>Brown rice</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/sweet-potato-banana-bites/" target="_blank">Sweet potato bites</a> &ndash; I subbed applesauce for banana and added fresh raspberries</li>
<li>Cabbage rolls &ndash; i used half ground pork/half ground beef, plus rice, onions, egg and garlic. For the sauce I used crushed tomatoes mixed with some Worcestershire sauce and a little brown sugar.</li>
<li>HB eggs</li>
<li>Veggies</li>
<li>Taco meat- I just cooked up the leftovers I didn&rsquo;t use in the cabbage rolls</li>
<li>Pulled pork &ndash; just put a pork shoulder in the crockpot with some broth and diced onions and peppers. I like to add bbq sauce to it as I eat it so I can control the amount that goes on.</li>
<li>Rotisserie chicken</li>
</ul><p>And here&rsquo;s what you guys have been up to:</p>

<div>Last week I prepped roasted sweet potato and butternut squash turkey sausage soup, chopped pineapple, sauteed veggies in coconut oil, kale and quinoa salad with chickpeas, mango, avocado, and lemon dressing, and hard boiled eggs.</div>
<div>I use the sauteed veggies for egg scrambles, the hard boiled eggs for snacks or on top of toast for a quick breakfast, and the soup and quinoa salad are for quick lunches. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll make a wrap with hummus and quinoa salad!</div>

<div>I really enjoy spending a couple hours on Sundays prepping food &ndash; it makes the busy work weeks much easier knowing that I have food ready to eat each day!&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, I prepped HB eggs, your quinoa breakfast bars (I subbed almond butter, spelt flour, and pomegranate arils), quinoa, white &amp; red kidney beans, frozen fruit to grab on the go each morning, broccoli, salads for lunches, pumpkin to add to oatmeal or yogurt, baked sweet potatoes, and marinated tofu for dinner! It&rsquo;s a great feeling once it&rsquo;s all done.</div>

<div>&nbsp;I love to cook but I rarely get a chance to during the busy week. Today I made a middle-eastern inspired brown rice and quinoa salad with tons of veggies to be eaten cold or warm as a side with dinner or for lunches, beer and cheddar soup from a Betty Crocker recipe for a warm winter dinner, tomato sauce to put over pasta for dinners, banana chocolate chip muffins for breakfasts or snacks, hard boiled eggs, and hopped veggies to throw in lunch bags. I was able to use things I already had in the kitchen but I think next weekend I am going to plan ahead for my&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;prep and do a grocery store run before I begin. I am absolutely going to make this a habit! Thank you so much!!!</div>
