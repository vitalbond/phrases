<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to another week of food prep!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8680" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sundayfoodprep.jpg" alt="sundayfoodprep Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 67" width="550" height="550" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 67"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With last weekend being a holiday weekend and this being a short week, I didn&rsquo;t actually do any food prep. We did go grocery shopping though, so here&rsquo;s how we survived the week:</p>
<p>Hubby ate peanut butter sandwiches for breakfast instead of his quinoa breakfast bars and went out to lunch two of the four days. On weeks I don&rsquo;t prep, I&rsquo;ve noticed I eat a lot of eggs for lunch. But&nbsp;this past week meat just wasn&rsquo;t sounding good to me, so eggs were just fine. For diners, I made lasagna on Tuesday, burrito bowls on Wednesday and mac and cheese with leftover veggies and beans, plus some chicken sausage on Thursday. On Friday night we ate leftover lasagna.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what a few of you prepped:</p>

<p>First things first, Veggies! Carrots, onion, cucumber, peppers, chickpeas, and lettuce, oh my!!</p>
<p>These veggies make it very easy to grab a quick salad or make one of my favorite pita hummus sandwiches&agrave;&nbsp;WW pita bread, 2 T hummus, handful romaine lettuce, peppers, with reduced fat feta cheese. Add some chicken if you got it. I also, bag up granola to add to Greek yogurt or one of my favorite summer salads&agrave;&nbsp;Romaine lettuce and spinach with strawberries, red grapes, and diced apples. I am loving light raspberry vinaigrette with it.. Another salad is the classic Greek salad with romaine lettuce and spinach, reduced fat feta cheese, red onions, peppers, and chickpeas. Just throw some oil and vinegar on it and eat up. Of course you gotta have snacks. I baggie up cucumbers, carrots and peppers to eat with hummus or by themselves.</p>
