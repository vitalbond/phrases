<p>I skipped out again this month, but a couple hundred others didn&rsquo;t! In case you&rsquo;re interested in joining for June, here are the details:</p>
<p><em><b>-On the 5th of every month, you will receive your&nbsp;penpal&nbsp;pairing via email. It will be your responsibility to contact your&nbsp;penpal&nbsp;and get their mailing address and any other information you might need like allergies or dietary restrictions.</b><br><b>-You will have until the 15th of the month to put your box of goodies in the mail. On the last day of the month, you will post about the goodies you received from your&nbsp;penpal!&nbsp;</b><br><b>-The boxes are to be filled with fun&nbsp;foodie&nbsp;things, local&nbsp;food&nbsp;items or even homemade treats! The spending limit is $15. The box must also include something written.&nbsp;</b><br><b>-Foodie&nbsp;Penpals&nbsp;is open to blog readers as well as bloggers.&nbsp;</b><br><b>-Foodie Penplas is open to US, Canadian &amp; European residents. &nbsp;Please note, Canadian Residents will be paired with other Canadians only. Same with Europeans. &nbsp;</b></em></p>
