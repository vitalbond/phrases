<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for more food prep.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12183" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-100.jpg" alt="photo 100 Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 62" width="550" height="550" title="Sunday Food Prep Inspiration 62"></p>
<p>I did a quick food prep last weekend after our Easter celebrations. Hubby lit the grill while I chopped some veggies. Then while the chicken, burgers and chicken sausage were grilling, I cooked a batch of <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/quinoa-breakfast-bars/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>quinoa breakfast bars</strong></span></a> and <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/sweet-potato-banana-bites/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sweet potato bites</strong></span></a>. We had a short week since my parents came into town on Thursday so this was the perfect amount to get us through!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what some of you have been up to:</p>
<p>Allie at <a href="http://bloguncool.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">UnCool</a> -</p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Top left: Hard-boiled eggs, which I&rsquo;ve been using to replace my usual protein bars. Wayyyyyy cheaper, and without all that fake sugar that makes my stomach hurt.</span><br style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;">Top right: Green protein shake freezer bags give me a super quick, easy breakfast when I wake up early to hit the gym and am not nearly coherent enough to make food without a little help.</span><br style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;">Bottom left: Grain-free vanilla coconut muffins. Yes. They taste like summer and I&rsquo;ve been eating them for breakfast, lunch, dinner &hellip; because, hello, they&rsquo;re healthy!</span><br style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;">Bottom right: Grain-free bread that I can&rsquo;t get enough of. My favorite combos so far are smashed avocado and sliced hard boiled egg or almond butter and cinnamon, preferably with the bread toasted. I eat it at breakfast or lunch and it keeps me full for a long time!</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #222222;">From Left to Right:</span><br style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;">Washed spinach for egg white scrambles and salads, chopped pineapple and strawberries for snacks, New Lemon Dill Tuna Cake recipe via @nutbutterrunner for lunches, roasted green beans and carrots-yummm! Hard boiled eggs-post workout, cucumber salad (cucumber, red and green onion, peppers, balsamic vinegar and apple cider vinegar), spaghetti squash- lunch/dinner, chopped onions and peppers to go with turkey sausages for dinner, and sweet potatoes for lunch/dinners! Not pictured are individual portions of peppers, onions, and grape tomatoes for egg scrambles! I like to prep most of my veggies/carb sources/snacks then cook my proteins the same night I eat for dinner. This is so helpful for me and the hubs and saves so much time in our busy life!</span></p>

<div style="color: #222222;">My first time doing&nbsp;<span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_793898618"><span class="aQJ">Sunday</span></span>&nbsp;food prep was a little slow (about 4 hours), but I kind of enjoyed having the time to myself in the kitchen. Now I&rsquo;ll just have to throw some things in the oven and do quick assembly during the week. So easy, I love it!</div>
