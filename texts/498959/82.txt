<p>It&rsquo;s a Boy! If you follow me on social media, you already know&hellip;because we just couldn&rsquo;t wait to spill the beans!</p>
<p>We had our appointment Monday morning and everything went well. We asked them to put the boy/girl pic in an envelope for us and when the appointment was over, we went out to breakfast and opened it.</p>
<p>Hubby has been saying boy since the beginning and he was thrilled. The look on his face when he opened the envelope was absolute joy. So priceless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy as well. I would have been happy either way, but I&rsquo;ve always thought if I was going to have a boy and a girl, I&rsquo;d prefer to have the boy first &ndash; protective older brother for the win!</p>
<p>After breakfast we spent the morning shopping&hellip;.I got some maternity clothes and we picked out a few outfits of baby as well!</p>

We also totally randomly happened to watch an episode of Coach on Monday night that totally related to our day. This is pretty much exactly how hubby reacted to our news:</p>

<p>You should be able to click the embeded &nbsp;video above to hear it. So funny.</p>
<p>So there you have it! Let the name planning begin <img src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Baby Bean Is A" class="wp-smiley" title="Baby Bean Is A">  We&rsquo;ve actually started looking at names and have several boy names we both like&hellip;so I think it will just be a matter of narrowing it down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today! Moms of boys, feel free to leave your advice, recommendations, send clothes and toys (kidding!) We&rsquo;d love to hear it!</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
