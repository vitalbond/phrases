<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>When I was in Chicago last weekend, my mom told me she never thought she’d see the day that my hubby would buy a gas grill…but that she thought it was probably one of the best investments we could have made, especially with the baby coming.</p>
<p>My in-laws are total charcoal grillers…and that’s what my hubby grew up with. I grew up with a gas grill but never really used it myself. When we moved into our house, we found someone giving away a charcoal grill for free in our neighborhood and that was that. We definitely got some use out of it…but probably not as much as we could have.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve had our gas grill for a couple of weeks now, I’m realizing that even you don’t get quite the same grill flavor, it was definitely worth the money. I rarely lit the charcoal grill because it was such a hassle…but this one is so easy! We’re finding ourselves using it several times a week. It’s just as easy as turning on the oven…and more fun in my opinion <img src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Grilled Stuffed Mushrooms" class="wp-smiley" title="Grilled Stuffed Mushrooms"></p>

<p>So far this week we’ve made cedar plank salmon, chicken and stuffed mushrooms on the grill! Today we’re going to talk about the mushrooms. These little guys were all Mr. Bean’s idea! We actually made them on a cedar plank, but we didn’t soak it very long so they picked up a pretty strong cedar flavor. If you’re not into that, soak the board longer or just buy the larger “stuffer” portobello mushrooms like we did and you can put them right on the grill racks!</p>
<p>Here’s the recipe:</p>
