<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of you have guessed by now&hellip;it&rsquo;s hard being a healthy living blogger when you&rsquo;re sick every day and living on peanut butter and jelly&hellip;but here&rsquo;s the official announcement!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">#babybean is coming- October 2014!</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow with all the details, but for now just know that hubby &amp; I couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled&hellip;and we want to thank all of YOU for the positive thoughts/prayers/well wishes over the past few months. We know it&rsquo;s no coincidence that this happened the month after we <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/its-not-easy-for-everyone/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shared our struggles on the blog</strong></span></a> and had all of you sending so much love our way!</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
&ndash;Lindsay&ndash;</p>
<p>PS. We leaked the news on social media last night. Thank you so much for all your kind words and excitement! You guys are the best!</p>
