<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that I&rsquo;m speaking at <a href="http://fitbloggin.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fitbloggin</strong></span></a>! I&rsquo;m thrilled to be speaking on a panel with <a href="http://www.runtothefinish.com/" target="_blank">Amanda</a>, <a href="http://www.badassfitness.com/" target="_blank">Shannon</a> &amp; <a href="http://blackgirlsguidetoweightloss.com/" target="_blank">Ericka</a>&hellip;moderated by <a href="http://www.ericadhouse.com/fitbloggin-keynote-panel/" target="_blank">Erica</a>.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=270277&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=263658" target="ejejcsingle">Click here to purchase the ebook from Oh My Veggies.</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I bought this ebook from Kiersten at <a href="http://www.ohmyveggies.com/" target="_blank">Oh My Veggies</a>&nbsp;the other day and I love it. I love supporting other bloggers, and she has an amazing, and also amazingly successful, blog&hellip;.There&rsquo;s nothing like learning from the best!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think the ebook would be helpful for all bloggers looking to make money off their blogs, not just food bloggers. She does a GREAT job of explaining the different options for ad networks and affiliate programs. She also gives advice about sponsored posts and working with brads, including how to pitch them (with sample emails!), what to charge, etc. Finally, she talks about freelance work, taxes and more! The ebook is $15 but it&rsquo;s well worth the price in my opinion!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&rsquo;re interested in checking it out, just click the link above, under the image, to get more info. (*Note, that&rsquo;s an affiliate link and I will make some money if you purchase the ebook through that link&hellip;but remember that I only promote products I truly believe in.)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Hubby &amp; I are heading to a wedding on Saturday. Two of our good friends are getting married here in Columbus! We&rsquo;re super excited to celebrate the big day! Now, if I just had something to wear&hellip;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You guys know I love <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://gonuttzo.com/products/" target="_blank">Nuttzo</a></strong></span>, right? I enjoy the Crunchy Dark Chocolate on my oatmeal pretty much every morning! Well, yesterday I just happened to go to the website to restock and guess what? They&rsquo;re having a major sale!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11988" alt="nuttzo Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nuttzo.jpg" width="550" height="388" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>All of the creamy flavors, plus my fav crunchy dark chocolate</strong> are on sale for $5! They&rsquo;re regularly $12.99 &amp; $17.99 a jar. If you&rsquo;ve been thinking about trying Nuttzo, now is the time! Or if you&rsquo;re already a fan like me, GO STOCK UP. The catch is the sale jars have a &ldquo;Best if used by July 2014&Prime; date. But guys, that&rsquo;s like 4 months from now. PLENTY of time to enjoy. I stocked up on 3 jars of crunchy chocolate <img src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Friday Things" class="wp-smiley" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://gonuttzo.com/products/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></span></a> to visit their website. (That&rsquo;s not an affiliate link. I&rsquo;m just sharing an awesome deal I found).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last week I got this cute (free) little package to celebrate the launch of a new (free) iphone app called Sprout It.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11976" alt="IMG 3869 Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3869.jpg" width="478" height="640" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The app is designed to help you with your home gardening and it really couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time since I was just thinking about how I wanted to be better with our garden this year than I was last year!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sprout It is packed with super helpful info:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11977" alt="garden1.jpg Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/garden1.jpg.jpg" width="550" height="550" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can scroll through their list of herbs, fruits and veggies and choose the things you&rsquo;re planning to grow. Click on individual names to get more info about how they grow, best time to plant, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11978" alt="garden2.jpg Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/garden2.jpg.jpg" width="550" height="550" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you add things to your garden, you can click on them to get info about how to plant, harvest and cook them and even how to deal with common problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11979" alt="IMG 4039 Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4039.jpg" width="427" height="640" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you need inspiration for what to grow at certain times of the year, or what to grow if you want to use herbs in cocktails etc&hellip;they have inspiration for that as well!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, if you&rsquo;re into gardening, definitely check it out! (PS. I&rsquo;m not getting paid to say this. I just think it&rsquo;s a cool app.)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Mr. Bean was very busy last weekend repainting our kitchen and family room. When we first moved in, we made some&hellip;you could say, poor color choices&hellip;Last weekend we finally picked out a better color and he repainted everything except our green accent wall, which we love. It looks amazing. We went from Buttercream and Humble Gold to Manchester Tan. It&rsquo;s hard to capture on camera but it looks great in person. Now to pick out some new curtains etc!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the true spirit of spring cleaning, we&rsquo;re planning a garage sale for the end of April and I am PUMPED.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11981" alt="garage sale e1395931268407 Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/garage-sale-e1395931268407.jpg" width="550" height="550" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have SO much stuff we need to get rid of, including lots of furniture and just a lot of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that&rsquo;s taking up space. It&rsquo;s gonna be pretty epic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m doing the last WOD of the Crossfit Open. I love the open, I really do&hellip;but by the end I&rsquo;m REALLY ready to just get back to regular workouts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11982" alt=" Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/download.jpeg" width="259" height="194" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p>I remember that happening last year and it&rsquo;s definitely happening again this year. Pushing through this last one and then it&rsquo;s back to normal, which will be nice!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There&rsquo;s just over 2 weeks left until my birthday. That also means you have just over 2 weeks left to do your taxes if you haven&rsquo;t done them already. Yes, my birthday is on tax day (April 15th).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11983" alt="IMG 3990 Friday Things" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_3990.jpg" width="550" height="550" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quite honestly, all I really want for my birthday this year is to be able to put away my winter coat for the season. I&rsquo;m so tired of bundling up to walk the dogs&hellip;but I am happy it&rsquo;s at least been sunny here most of the time (except when it snowed this week). So anyways, Mother Nature has a couple of weeks to get her act together and then I&rsquo;m ready for Spring. It&rsquo;s crazy how the seasons have shifted since I was little. It ALWAYS used to be warm on my birthday when I was younger. Now, half the time it snows through the middle of April and then it&rsquo;s HOT in October when it&rsquo;s supposed to be Fall. #notcool</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well I think that&rsquo;s enough rambling for today. Let&rsquo;s chat:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What&rsquo;s new with you?! Any big weekend plans?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enjoy!<br>
