<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>I realized it&rsquo;s been over a month since I did my last weekly eats post, so I thought we&rsquo;d play catchup today. As you guys know, I&rsquo;ve had some pretty terrible &ldquo;morning&rdquo; ie all day sickness since week 5. Here we are in week 16 and I&rsquo;m still not over the hump. So, I&rsquo;ve been doing my best to eat what I can.</p>
<p>Are the eats &ldquo;perfect and totally RD approved&rdquo;? No.<br>
Are we eating out more than we typically do? Yes.<br>
But this is real life.<br>
I&rsquo;m not gonna lie to you guys and pretend eating has been just peachy&hellip;<br>
In reality, food has kinda sucked lately!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that I am able to finally eat some vegetables &ndash; they were pretty much unheard of in the early weeks&hellip;so that&rsquo;s a step in the right direction!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve been eating:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12251" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weekly3.jpg" alt="weekly3 Weekly Eats 57" width="550" height="550" title="Weekly Eats 57"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">These right here have been my staples since the beginning.<br>
Oatmeal, eggs and peanut butter and jelly.<br>
They rarely fail me.<br>
As a result, I&rsquo;ve been eating them pretty much daily.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Lots of eggs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12253" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weekly1.jpg" alt="weekly1 Weekly Eats 57" width="550" height="550" title="Weekly Eats 57"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We&rsquo;ve gone out to breakfast a few times.<br>
Pancakes and eggs for me, breakfast burrito for hubby.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12254" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weekly4.jpg" alt="weekly4 Weekly Eats 57" width="550" height="550" title="Weekly Eats 57"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mac and cheese has been another savior.<br>
Sometimes homemade.<br>
Usually <a href="http://www.annies.com/products/mac-cheese/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Annie&rsquo;s Organic</strong></span></a>.<br>
Typically with a protein like chicken sausage or homemade nuggets.<br>
Green beans finally taste good again! Yay!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12255" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weekly5.jpg" alt="weekly5 Weekly Eats 57" width="550" height="550" title="Weekly Eats 57"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&rsquo;ve been eating canned tuna about once a week.<br>
Hubby loves lasagna so I&rsquo;ve made that a few times.<br>
And enchiladas are always good.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12256" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weekly8.jpg" alt="weekly8 Weekly Eats 57" width="550" height="550" title="Weekly Eats 57"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I made a batch of <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/freezer-to-crockpot-cilantro-lime-chicken/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Crockpot Cilantro Lime Chicken</strong></span></a> one week.<br>
Went on a bit of an orzo and chicken sausage kick.<br>
Had leftover pinepple so made some <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/pineapple-chicken-with-bok-choy/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pineapple Chicken</strong></span></a>.<br>
Even made a batch of Cheesy BBQ Pork meatballs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Been eating lots of chicken sausages.<br>
Quesadillas pretty much weekly.<br>
And when I just can&rsquo;t stomach anything at all-<br>
Chicken and brown rice with soy sauce has saved me more than once.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12258" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weekly7.jpg" alt="weekly7 Weekly Eats 57" width="550" height="550" title="Weekly Eats 57"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I&rsquo;ve eaten Chipotle more often in the past 2 months,<br>
than the past 3 years combined.<br>
Pizza on occasion.<br>
Chips &amp; salsa finally taste ok again,<br>
So we went out for tacos.<br>
Chicken sandwich with a fried egg.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12259" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/weekly10.jpg" alt="weekly10 Weekly Eats 57" width="550" height="550" title="Weekly Eats 57"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I made some banana bread.<br>
And then turned the leftovers into banana bread truffles.<br>
I restocked the freezer with <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/freezer-chocolate-peanut-butter-cups/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PB Chocolate Cups</strong></span></a>.<br>
Made a batch of <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/no-bake-protein-bars/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No-Bake Protein Bars</strong></span></a> for a friend&hellip;<br>
And made an extra batch for us.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Changed things up from microwaved oatmeal to <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/baked-oatmeal/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Baked Oatmeal</strong></span></a>.<br>
Yogurt occasionally sounds good so I made a <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/cinnamon-roasted-sweet-potato-parfait/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>parfait</strong></span></a>.<br>
Made hubby some pork chops with bacon &amp; apples.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">Enjoyed my birthday ice cream cupcakes.<br>

Although dessert has been making me really sick lately,<br>
so taking a break from that.<br>
Made a batch of Black Bottom Cupcakes.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So there you have it. Fingers crossed the nausea goes away in the next week or two. I did get some medicine from my doctor at my 16 week appt that I&rsquo;m going to try if things don&rsquo;t improve in the next week.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Let&rsquo;s chat:<br>
How have your eats been lately?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enjoy!<br>
