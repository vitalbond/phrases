<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for another Recipe Redux post. I was actually supposed to post yesterday&hellip;but pregnancy brain is getting the best of me and I scheduled it for the wrong day. Anyways&hellip;I took last month off because I wasn&rsquo;t doing much cooking but I&rsquo;m trying to get back into the swing of things.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12150" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/potsticker1.jpg.jpg" alt="potsticker1.jpg {Recipe Redux} Potstickers" width="550" height="368" title="{Recipe Redux} Potstickers"></p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s theme was:</p>
<div class="entry-content" style="color: #6e5300;">
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Treasured Cookware</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Share a story of classic cookware &ndash; and a healthy recipe to go with it. Some of us will be celebrating Mother&rsquo;s Day next month (May 11,) but it&rsquo;s more than once a year that&nbsp;<em>many</em>&nbsp;of us cook with a pan, a wooden spoon or another piece of cookware passed on to us from the kitchens of our favorite relatives. Let&rsquo;s see what you can cook up with your treasured kitchen tool!</span></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with my mom while I was growing up. She taught me a lot of what I know about cooking and baking and I have a lot of great memories of our kitchen time together. There was a time, when I first moved out&hellip;to go to college and then into my first apartment, that I had a lot of hand-me-downs from my mom&rsquo;s kitchen. Over the past 10 years or so, as hubby and I moved into our first house, got married etc&hellip;I&rsquo;ve slowly been replacing a lot of the old, with new.</p>
<p>Of course there are a few things I have held onto for sentimental reasons. The kitchen tool I picked for today&rsquo;s post is a bit non-traditional. It&rsquo;s not a pot or pan or baking gadget. It&rsquo;s a wonton press.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12133" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/61Yge584HBL._SL1500_1.jpg" alt="61Yge584HBL. SL1500 1 {Recipe Redux} Potstickers" width="550" height="711" title="{Recipe Redux} Potstickers"></p>
<p>It probably only cost a few dollars (it&rsquo;s very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Helen-Chens-Asian-Kitchen-Dumpling/dp/B000PLUIIS/ref=pd_sim_k_5?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1D57VEY2YVHP1K8G2XB0" target="_blank">this one</a>)&hellip;but it&rsquo;s something I always remember being in my mom&rsquo;s kitchen. When my parents sold their house a few years ago, it was one of the first things I snatched up to take to my own kitchen.</p>
<p>So, when I saw this prompt, I immediately thought of it sitting buried in my drawer and decided to make some potstickers since hubby and I both love them! Potstickers are usually made with ground pork&hellip;but honestly, I didn&rsquo;t want to have to worry about it getting cooked all the way, so I chose to use some leftover pork tenderloin I had already cooked.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the recipe I used:</p>

<div class="ERSNotes">You could add some shredded cabbage to these if you wanted to.<br>If you want to take an extra step, throw everything in a food processor and pulse a couple of times to help combine things. If you&rsquo;re lazy like me, just make sure you chop your pork very small. <br>Don&rsquo;t overfill your wontons or they&rsquo;ll break.<br>For a slightly healthier version, you could just steam these instead of pan frying and then steaming.</div>

<p>Make potstickers can be a bit tedious..but they&rsquo;re so delicious that I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s worth it every once and a while.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned in the notes above:</p>
<ul><li>I would have included some shredded cabbage if I had some.</li>
<li>Since the wontons are so small, make sure you either dice your pork very finely, or pulse in the food processor a few times to help your filling come together.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overfill the wontons. You really can&rsquo;t fit very much in each one without causing them to rip.</li>
<li>You can skip the pan frying step if you want but you won&rsquo;t get the nice brown color. I really didn&rsquo;t use that much oil&hellip;just enough so there was a thin layer on the bottom of the pan each time</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
