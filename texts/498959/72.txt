<div><p>Hi Friends-</p>
<p>Happy Memorial Day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12476 size-large" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photo1-550x550.jpg" alt="photo1 550x550 Freedom Isnt Free" width="550" height="550" title="Freedom Isnt Free"></p>
<p>As you head off to your cookouts and enjoy your day off, take a few minutes to thank the men and women who have paid the ultimate price to make it possible for us to enjoy the freedoms that many of us take for granted every day.</p>
<h3>They&rsquo;re gone&hellip;.but will not be forgotten.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disconnecting to reconnect today. Bean Bytes will be back tomorrow.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>&ndash;Lindsay&ndash;</p></div>
