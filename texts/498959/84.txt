<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for some more random ramblings.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12576" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_5883-e1402011529517.jpg" alt="IMG 5883 e1402011529517 Friday Things" width="550" height="550" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p>Long time readers might remember a few of these scenes from last June&hellip;hubby had surgery on his left shoulder to repair a torn labrum&hellip;.Well, next week we&rsquo;re doing it all over again. Except this time it&rsquo;s the right shoulder and it&rsquo;s a torn rotator cuff. His first surgery and recovery did NOT go well&hellip;so we&rsquo;re both a bit apprehensive about this one. (More like- HOLD ME I&rsquo;M SCARED!) However, the hope is that this one will go more smoothly and he&rsquo;ll be well into his recovery by the time baby bean comes along. He&rsquo;ll be in a sling for six weeks again, except this time it&rsquo;s his dominant arm which makes things more complicated. Anyways, the big day is next Wednesday so please send positive thoughts our way. And meals. And a cleaning lady. And someone to mow our grass <img src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon wink Friday Things" class="wp-smiley" title="Friday Things">  Pregnant wife and recovering hubby is going to make for an interesting combination.</p>

<p>Several of you have asked about my spiralizer. I bought the <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/paderno-sprializer/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Paderno Spiralizer from William Sonoma</strong></span></a> a few months ago and I love it. It&rsquo;s the only one I&rsquo;ve ever used so I don&rsquo;t have anything to compare it to, but it&rsquo;s worked really well for me so far! Plus it&rsquo;s only $40!</p>

<p>I found this <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/150110643/hashtag-onesie-i-have-my-own-hashtag?ref=favs_view_1" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>hashtag onsie</strong></span></a> on Etsy the other day and I mean&hellip;#babybean14 pretty much NEEDS it? Am I right? It&rsquo;s from the Etsy store <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PoofyCheeksShop?ref=l2-shopheader-name" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PoofyCheeksShop</strong></span></a>! She has all sorts of cute stuff!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a glider for the nursery and I scored a pretty sweet deal on the model&nbsp;above on Craigslist. It&rsquo;s a Dutailier and it comes with an ottoman, plus it reclines and locks. We&rsquo;re getting it in like-new condition at about half the price! It&rsquo;s not my first choice of color, but to me it&rsquo;s worth it to save the money. Plus, throw a blanket over the back and it can be pretty much any color you want, right?!</p>

<p>Canadian friends, check these out for me. I can&rsquo;t remember where I came across this company, <a href="http://raenergyfoods.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ra Energy</strong></span></a>, but I want to try them so badly and they&rsquo;re only sold in Canada for now!! They&rsquo;re basically a blend of delicious, healthy ingredients that you can sprinkle on pretty much anything.</p>

<p>So fun! I&rsquo;m patiently waiting for them to come to the US!</p>

My mom got me a <a href="http://flipbelt.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Flipbelt</strong></span></a> for Christmas and after forgetting about it for several months, I&rsquo;ve been using it on my walks with the dogs lately. I like to take my phone with me and in the winter I just throw it in my coat pocket. Now that it&rsquo;s warmer, it&rsquo;s annoying to carry, so I like being able to put it in the flipbelt to keep my hands free. I also started keeping a few dollars in it because last week, I was passed by the ice cream truck twice and had no money to buy a treat! AND there was a lemonade stand that I couldn&rsquo;t visit! So now I&rsquo;m prepared.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few friends do giveaways for <a href="http://www.pinkblushmaternity.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pink Blush Maternity</strong></span></a> clothes so I finally checked out their site and I&rsquo;m kind of obsessed. Want ALL the things. So many cute tops and dresses!! Now if I could just decide what to order!</p>
<p>Ok, I think that&rsquo;s all for today!</p>
<h3>Let&rsquo;s chat:<br>
Have anything fun planned for the weekend?</h3>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
