<h3 style="text-align: center;">Sweet Potato Protein Pancakes</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12194" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sweet-potato-protein-pancakes.jpg.jpg" alt="sweet potato protein pancakes.jpg Sweet Potato Protein Pancakes" width="428" height="640" title="Sweet Potato Protein Pancakes"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I made these on Monday because we didn&rsquo;t go grocery shopping over the weekend and I needed something for lunch. We had a couple of leftover baked sweet potatoes from dinner on Saturday night&hellip;plus some cottage cheese&hellip;and we always have eggs. Voila! These pancakes were born. I had no idea whether they&rsquo;re work or not when I started making them.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A few things to note about these pancakes before we go any further.</p>
<ol><li>If you&rsquo;re looking for fluffy, traditional pancakes, these are not them.</li>
<li>There is no protein powder in these pancakes. They&rsquo;re high in protein thanks to the other ingredients.</li>
<li>Not everyone will like these. They make hubby gag because he hates the texture of stuff like this. Since they&rsquo;re not made with flour, they are a little &ldquo;wet&rdquo; in the middle&hellip;but if you&rsquo;re patient while cooking them, they will set up and you can easily flip them like regular pancakes.</li>
<li>These do not taste like cottage cheese.</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you make them:<br></p><div class="easyrecipe" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Recipe"> <div itemprop="name" class="ERSName">Sweet Potato Protein Pancakes</div>  <div class="ERSTopRight"> <img itemprop="image" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sweet-potato-protein-pancakes.jpg.jpg" width="205"></div> <div itemprop="description" class="ERSSummary">A high protein, lower-carb breakfast option!</div> <div class="divERSHeadItems"> <div class="ERSAuthor">Author: <span itemprop="author">Lindsay L</span></div> <div class="ERSServes">Serves: <span itemprop="recipeYield">1-2</span></div> </div> <div class="ERSIngredients"> <div class="ERSIngredientsHeader ERSHeading">Ingredients</div> <ul><li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">2 eggs</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; cup oats</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; cup cottage cheese</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; cup cooked, mashed sweet potato</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; teaspoon baking soda</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; teaspoon baking powder</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">1 tsp sugar or other sweetener (optional)</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">cinnamon, to taste</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">peanut butter, for drizzling (optional)</li> </ul></div> <div class="ERSInstructions"> <div class="ERSInstructionsHeader ERSHeading">Instructions</div> <ol><li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">In a high-powered blender, combine all ingredients and blend until smooth.</li> <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Pour into a greased pan or griddle over medium heat.</li> <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Let sit for 3-4 minutes before flipping.</li> <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Flip carefully and let cook another 2-3 minutes.</li> <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Flip again and let cook for 2 more minutes.</li> </ol></div>  </div><br>

<p>Patience is the key when cooking these. Pour in the batter, let them sit for 4-5 minutes, flip them and let them sit for a few minutes and then flip them again and let them cook a little more. You can&rsquo;t have your heat too high otherwise they will burn&hellip;but the longer cooking time helps them solidify a bit more in the middle. I&rsquo;m not really sure if you need the baking soda in this recipe. I accidentally put it in instead of baking powder. When I realized, I just added the baking powder as well and it worked just fine.</p>

<p>I think these taste fabulous. If you don&rsquo;t like the taste of eggs, you probably won&rsquo;t like these. They actually remind me of a very eggy french toast&hellip;which I love&hellip;and hubby hates. Drizzle with nut butter if you want (or your favorite pancake topping.</p>
<p>I was curious how many grams of protein were actually in these pancakes so I put the&nbsp;recipe into My Fitness Pal&nbsp;and here&rsquo;s what it said:</p>

<p>So you could share or eat the whole batch like I did. Note- I didn&rsquo;t use any sweetener and thought they were fine but some might like them sweeter. You could also try using 1/2 cup oats instead of only 1/4 cup. Note the nutrition calculation doesn&rsquo;t include the peanut butter drizzle or whatever you used to grease the pan. I&rsquo;m including it mostly to show you that you&rsquo;ll get 15-30 grams of protein depending on how many of these you eat! My batch made 8 medium pancakes.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
