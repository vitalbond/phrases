<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have time to do my food prep this weekend (gasp!)&hellip;i know, i know! Oh well, it happens. It did, however, get me thinking about how important the freezer is for weeks like this when I&rsquo;m too busy to prep food. So, I thought I&rsquo;d make a list of some foods that freeze well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12015" alt="10 foods that freeze well 10 Foods That Freeze Well" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/10-foods-that-freeze-well.jpg" width="550" height="737" title="10 Foods That Freeze Well"></p>
<p>These are things you can make ahead of time, make double batches of, etc and stick in the freezer until you need them!</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for you:</p>

<p>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Burgers</strong></span> &ndash; Whether they&rsquo;re meat or veggies, burgers freezer really well. You can cook them ahead of time and then let them cool, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze in ziploc bags&hellip;then just reheat when you&rsquo;re ready to eat. Or, you can just form into patties and freeze raw so all you have to do is thaw and cook them.</p>

Things like lasagna are great to make ahead of time, freeze and then just warm in the oven on a busy night.

<p>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pancakes &amp; Waffles</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- These are great to have on hand for busy mornings. Wrap 3-4 pancakes (or however many you want for an individual serving) in saran wrap and freeze in Ziploc bags. In the morning, unwrap and pop them in the toaster or microwave to heat through.</p>

<p>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Soups</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- Most soups freeze extremely well! Make a double batch of your favorite, let cool completely, then transfer half to a gallon-sized Ziploc bag. Store flat to save space in the freezer!</p>

<p>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Broths &amp; Sauces</strong></span> &ndash; Instead of throwing away your veggie scrap, use them to make a batch of veggie broth. Then freeze in 2-4 cup containers and thaw when needed! Got extra tomatoes in the summer? Make some homemade tomato sauce and freeze to use throughout the winter. Add some meat or lentils to make a bolognese or some extra veggies for added nutrients and then all you have to do is cook up some pasta on a busy night, defrost the sauce and dinner is served!</p>

<p>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Muffins/Breads/Doughs</strong></span> &ndash; Muffins can make a great grab-and-go breakfast or snack- just be sure to choose ones that have some protein and fiber for staying power. Homemade bread is great because you can avoid the long ingredient lists of store-bought breads. Make a couple extra loaves and stick them in the freezer to use in the following weeks. You can also make things like pizza dough ahead of time..then just transfer to the fridge to thaw before homemade pizza night!</p>

<p>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Energy Balls </strong></span>- These make the perfect snack, and I love keeping them in the freezer. They stay cold and tasty but don&rsquo;t freeze all the way through so you can&rsquo;t eat them. My personal favorite combo is 2 cups chopped, pitted dates, 1 1/2 cups almonds, 1/2 cup peanut butter&hellip;plus some chia seeds and pumpkin seeds. There are endless combinations out there.</p>

<p>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Burritos</strong></span> &ndash; You can customize these to be breakfast burritos or more traditional burritos for lunch or dinner. Wrap them individually, then defrost in the microwave for a quick meal!</p>

<p>9. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fresh herbs</strong></span> &ndash; Whether you get fancy and make pesto or simply just need to store a surplus of fresh herbs from the Farmer&rsquo;s market, ice cube trays make a great vehicle for storing fresh herbs. Spoon the pesto straight into the trays, freeze, then remove and store in an airtight container. For plain herbs, chop well and place a couple tablespoons in each tray. Fill with olive oil or broth and freeze&hellip;then just throw the herb cubes into the pan when you&rsquo;re making a dish that calls for them!</p>

<p>10. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Beans &amp; Lentils</strong></span> &ndash; You can make a whole bag of dried beans or lentils at once, let them cool and then divide them into ziploc bags and store them in the freezer. When you&rsquo;re ready to use them, smack the bag on the counter a few times to loosen and add directly to whatever you&rsquo;re making. For best results, undercook them slightly initially and they&rsquo;ll cook a little more in whatever dish you add them to:</p>
