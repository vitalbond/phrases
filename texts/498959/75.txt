<p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s post is a 2-for-1. I&rsquo;ve got a yummy recipe to share with you and also a great program to tell you about! Let&rsquo;s start with the program. As you may or may not know, the reason I originally went back to school to become an RD was because of my interest in child nutrition. I was teaching pre-school and it was so sad to see the number of 3-4 year olds in my class who were already overweight and bringing less-than-nutritious lunches to school every day.</p>
<p>One of my favorite activities to do with&nbsp;my preschoolers was to introduce them to new vegetables. We did all sorts of taste tests, planted vegetable seeds etc. I wanted to help them get familiar with vegetables they might not have been seeing at home!</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve branched out to other areas of nutrition, child nutrition will always be a passion of mine, especially now that I have a kiddo of my own on the way! So, when <a href="http://www.produceforkids.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Produce For Kids</strong></span></a> reached out to me asking me to help spread the word about their program, I jumped at the chance!</p>
<p></p><center><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12495" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/logo.png" alt="logo Veggie Corn Muffins" width="403" height="200" title="Veggie Corn Muffins"></center><em>Produce For Kids is a&nbsp;national organization dedicated to educating families on the benefits of healthy eating, providing simple meal solutions and raising money for children&rsquo;s non-profit organizations. Produce for Kids partners with the produce industry and local grocery store retailers to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.produceforkids.com/about-us">host two campaigns each year</a>&nbsp;to raise funds for children&rsquo;s non&shy;profit organizations while educating families about the benefits of healthy eating with fresh produce. The best part (besides fruits and veggies, of course): ALL funds raised stay local and go to area children&rsquo;s organizations!</em>
<p><em>This spring, Meijer stores across the country are&nbsp;joining retailers nationwide to participate in Produce for Kids&rsquo;&nbsp;Get Healthy, Give Hope&nbsp;campaign, which will raise money for Meijer&rsquo;s designated local charity &ndash; local&nbsp;<a href="http://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/">Children&rsquo;s Miracle Network Hospitals</a>.&nbsp;To help Meijer increase its donation, shoppers are encouraged from&nbsp;<span data-term="goog_146005842">May 25 to June 21</span>&nbsp;to add more produce to their grocery carts. All participating fruit and vegetable suppliers will make a consumption-based donation to Children&rsquo;s Miracle Network Hospitals.</em></p>
<p>Here are some of the awesome sponsors for this campaign including:</p>
<ul><li>Bolthouse Farms</li>
<li>Dole</li>
<li>Earthbound Farm</li>
<li>Nature Sweet</li>
<li>Green Giant Fresh/Potandon Produce</li>
<li>RealSweet</li>
<li>T. Marzetti Company</li>
<li>Well-Pict Berries</li>
</ul><p>I love this campaign because as an RD I&rsquo;m always encouraging people to load up their carts with fruits and veggies&hellip;and now, that simple act will benefit both your family and kids in need!</p>
<p>And in case you need some inspiration for using up those delicious veggies you buy, I have an idea for you!</p>

<p>Muffins! And not just any muffins. They&rsquo;re packed with veggies, made with whole wheat flour and have yogurt added for some extra protein. Plus they&rsquo;re lower in sugar than most muffins! These are kid friendly and easily customizable. You can shred up all sorts of veggies to throw in there. I added some cheese, which is optional, but tasty! You could also make these mini-sized to give them even more kid appeal!<br></p><div class="easyrecipe" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Recipe"> <div itemprop="name" class="ERSName">Veggie Corn Muffins</div>  <div class="ERSTopRight"> <img itemprop="image" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/veggie-corn-muffins-2.jpg.jpg" width="205"></div> <div class="ERSTimes"> <div class="ERSTime"> <div class="ERSTimeHeading">Prep time</div> <div class="ERSTimeItem"> <time itemprop="prepTime" datetime="PT5M">5 mins</time></div> </div> <div class="ERSTime ERSTimeRight"> <div class="ERSTimeHeading">Cook time</div> <div class="ERSTimeItem"> <time itemprop="cookTime" datetime="PT20M">20 mins</time></div> </div> <div class="ERSTime ERSTimeRight"> <div class="ERSTimeHeading">Total time</div> <div class="ERSTimeItem"> <time itemprop="totalTime" datetime="PT25M">25 mins</time></div> </div> <div class="ERSClearLeft">&nbsp;</div> </div> <div itemprop="description" class="ERSSummary">A veggie-packed muffin the kids will love!</div> <div class="divERSHeadItems"> <div class="ERSAuthor">Author: <span itemprop="author">Lindsay L</span></div> <div class="ERSServes">Serves: <span itemprop="recipeYield">10-12</span></div> </div> <div class="ERSIngredients"> <div class="ERSIngredientsHeader ERSHeading">Ingredients</div> <ul><li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">1&frac14; cup shredded vegetables, squeezed to remove excess water</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; cup corn kernals, frozen or fresh</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac34; cup plain yogurt (Greek or regular)</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">2 eggs</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac12; cup shredded Cheddar Cheese, optional</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">1 cup white whole wheat flour</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac34; cup cornmeal</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">&frac14; cup sugar</li> <li class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">1 teaspoon baking soda</li> </ul></div> <div class="ERSInstructions"> <div class="ERSInstructionsHeader ERSHeading">Instructions</div> <ol><li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li> <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Combine shredded veggies, corn, yogurt, eggs and cheese in a large bowl and stir to combine.</li> <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Add remaining ingredients and stir until just combined.</li> <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">Spoon into lined muffin tins and bake for 18 minutes.</li> </ol></div> <div class="ERSNotesDiv"> <div class="ERSNotesHeader">Notes</div> <div class="ERSNotes">Makes 10-12 large muffins.<br>I used zucchini, carrots and red peppers for the shredded vegetables.

<p>Soooooo good! Get creative with the veggies you throw in there. You could add some chopped broccoli or broccoli stems and shredded sweet potato or summer squash would also be great additions!</p>
