<p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Time for another roundup with my friends at <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/www.foodie.com" target="_blank">Foodie</a>. The over-arching theme for this month was &ldquo;Sunday Dinner&rdquo;. Past that, it was really &nbsp;left up to us what kind of collection to put together. I chose casseroles because I&rsquo;m kind of in love with them. In my opinion, they&rsquo;re the easiest way to pack a ton of delicious flavors into one dish. The combinations are pretty much endless and usually they require very little effort. Win, win, win!</p>
<p>So, I rounded up&nbsp;<strong>15 Casseroles for Sunday Dinner</strong>&nbsp;to share with you guys. I included some of my favorite bloggers like&nbsp;<a href="http://ifoodreal.com/" target="_blank">iFoodReal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://ohmyveggies.com/" target="_blank">Oh My Veggies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pinchofyum.com/" target="_blank">Pinch of Yum</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.preventionrd.com/" target="_blank">PreventionRD</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.neighborfoodblog.com/" target="_blank">NeighborFood</a>&nbsp;and more!
