<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>It’s Friday and I’m on my way to Fitbloggin this afternoon! <a href="http://www.foodfitnessandfamilyblog.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This lady</strong></span></a> is picking me up at the airport and I can’t WAIT to finally meet her <img src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Friday Things" class="wp-smiley" title="Friday Things"></p>
<p>Let’s see…what else is new?</p>

<p>Wednesday was the 6 year anniversary of us closing on and moving into our first house! On that night six years ago, we ate Wendy’s for dinner. Even though we almost never eat fast food anymore, we like to keep up tradition once a year so we headed through the drive-thru Wednesday night. I wasn’t feeling well so all I got were fries and boy were they a disappointment. Super soggy and not tasty at all. I ate a few, gave some to the dogs, then threw them away and made eggs and toast for dinner.</p>

This week I learned the hard way this week that ice cream sandwiches are pretty much the hardest thing ever to photograph. Add in the fact that the cookies are red and the berries are blue, with white ice cream, and let’s just say it was an all-afternoon affair. Recipe coming next week <img src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Friday Things" class="wp-smiley" title="Friday Things"></p>

I heard on the radio this week that Wednesday was exactly 6 months til Christmas. Then I realized I’d have a baby by then. Cue minor freakout!</p>

Next weekend we need to work on our baby registry. Has anyone used <a href="http://babyli.st/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BabyList</strong></span></a>? If not, where did you register? If I choose an actual store it will probably be Buy Buy Baby. I left hubby a list of things to research while I’m gone this weekend like video monitors, strollers, etc.</p>

<p>We got our first order from <a href="http://www.greenbeandelivery.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Green Bean Delivery</strong></span></a> yesterday. I’m testing it out for a few weeks and then I’ll give you guys a full review! Perfect timing this week since I can’t make it to the farmer’s market this weekend. I made the corn for dinner last night and hubby ate some of the broccoli and lettuce for a salad. I also turned one of those zucchini into zucchini bread!</p>

I had one in pdf form that was awesome, but someone else made it for me and I hated having to bug her every time I needed numbers updated. This way I’ll be able to do the updating myself! It took a while and it’s not perfect, but I did it!

<p>I just finished up a series of six lunch and learns with a local company and in our last one we focused on nutrition and exercise. Someone brought up <a href="http://www.charitymiles.org/" target="_blank">Charity Miles</a> and I’m excited to start using it when I walk the dogs every day!</p>
<p>That’s all I’ve got for today! Tell me something you’re excited about this weekend!</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
