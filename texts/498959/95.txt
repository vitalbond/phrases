<p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>As you guys know, I’m part of the Pompeian Insider Program and am creating some recipes using their products (like this <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/strawberry-balsamic-dressing/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Strawberry Balsamic Dressing</strong></span></a>!) This month, as part of the program, we got to do something kinda cool – we attended a virtual olive oil tasting and then we got to choose one of the oils to use in our next recipe.</p>

<p>Pompeian sent us this little tasting kit…which I took some nice pictures of and then accidentally deleted. But I borrowed one from Christine so you can get the idea:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">For the tasting itself, we Google Hangout/webcast with <span style="color: #222222;">Dr. Luisito Cercaci. He took us through each of the six different oils and taught us a little bit about what makes them unique, what they’re best used for and how to taste them/what we should be tasting for. Basically, we poured a little bit into a tasting cup and then swirled the cup around in our hands to help warm the oil a little bit and activate the flavor compounds. Then we smelled it and then tasted it, before spitting it back out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Olive oil has to undergo rigorous chemical tests for quality and flavor…and did you know that the color of the oil is fairly insignificant? That’s why they gave us blue cups…because color should impact judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First we tried 3 more traditional varieties and then 3 Extra Virgin Premium Varieties. It was interesting to taste the differences between them. Some were very mild, typically used in more delicate dishes that include vegetables or fish…and some were more pungent and are better used with meats and in sauces where a stronger flavor is desired.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I decided to use the Arbequina variety, which was very mild, sweet and fresh. It wasn’t super bitter or pungent and even had a bit of a green almond flavor. I decided I wanted my recipe to be vegetable based so I thought this would be perfect because it would allow other flavors to come through and not be overpowering.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I’m typically a french fry kinda girl and I tend to stay away from wedges, but these were SO good. Plus, cutting them into wedges is much easier and quicker than cutting into small little fries. I keep hearing about how people toss their sweet potato fries in cornstarch to get them crispier. I did that with the first batch of these and honestly didn’t like it. It left a bit of a weird coating on the outside, so for batch #2 I juste used the seasonings themselves and they tasted great!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These wedges are not crispy, but you get the nice roasted outside to give you a little crunch and then a perfectly soft inside!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s how you make them:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Feel free to adjust the spices to your liking, making them spicier or sweeter if you want to. The sugar starts to caramelize a little bit, which is delicious and then you get hit with a hint of spice. So good.</p>
