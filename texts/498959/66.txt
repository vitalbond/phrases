<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a longtime reader, you&rsquo;ll know that although I used to participate in the ever-popular What I Ate Wednesday (WIAW) blogland trend, I stopped several years ago. I stopped for my own personal reasons, the&nbsp;main one being that I prefer my Weekly Eats posts where I can share a larger variety of my eats with you guys.</p>
<p>However, I do still get requests to share what I eat on a daily basis&hellip;and it just so happens that there&rsquo;s currently a fun little version of WIAW going around among my fellow Registered Dietitians and I&rsquo;ve been asked several times (by <a href="http://www.loveandzest.com/2014/05/what-i-ate-wednesday-rd-edition.html" target="_blank">Kristina</a>, <a href="http://www.fannetasticfood.com/2014/05/14/what-i-ate-wednesday-rd-edition/" target="_blank">Anne</a> &amp; <a href="http://peaceloveandfood.com/" target="_blank">Kara</a>) to participate, so here I am!</p>
<p>Side note- I realize today is Tuesday, not Wednesday, but I have a Recipe Redux post scheduled for tomorrow, so I bumped my post up to today.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s a look at what I ate yesterday. As always, please remember that nutrition is individual and what works for me may not be best for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12377" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/breakfast.jpg.jpg" alt="breakfast.jpg An RD WIAW" width="478" height="435" title="An RD WIAW"></p>
<p>Breakfast &ndash; 8AM</p>
<p>Rolled oats + 2% milk + frozen berries microwaved for 2 and a half minutes, topped with peanut butter, pumpkin seeds and a few chocolate chips<br>
Water to drink</p>
<p>This is what I eat pretty much every M-F and some weekends. Sometimes we go out to breakfast on the weekends, or I&rsquo;ll make eggs occasionally. &nbsp;I prefer to top my oats with <a href="http://gonuttzo.com/products/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>crunchy chocolate Nuttzo</strong> </span></a>but I&rsquo;m fresh out!</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12379" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lunch1.jpg.jpg" alt="lunch1.jpg An RD WIAW" width="478" height="403" title="An RD WIAW"></p>
<p>Lunch &ndash; 12PM</p>
<p>Mexican Enchilada Casserole + Garden of Eatin&rsquo; Blue Corn Tortilla Chips + bell pepper strips + fruit bowl shared with hubby.<br>
Water to drink</p>
<p>To make the casserole I combined chopped zucchini, peppers, onions, corn, black beans and cooked, diced chicken in a casserole dish. I added some shredded Cabot Cheese and mixed it all together. For the sauce I made 1/2 a batch of <a href="http://damndelicious.net/2014/03/17/homemade-enchilada-sauce/" target="_blank">this homemade enchilada sauce</a>&nbsp;and used half of it mixed with a few spoonfuls of plain Greek yogurt. I poured the sauce over everything, mixed it together and baked it at 375 for 30 min. For lunch I just reheated in the microwave.</p>
<p>Side note- I usually would have topped this with avocado&hellip;but pregnancy has been messing with my tastebuds and I don&rsquo;t crave it as often as I used to. Hopefully that&rsquo;s just temporary!</p>
<p>Sometimes I eat a morning snack but most mornings I&rsquo;m just busy working through the morning and don&rsquo;t really get all that hungry until lunch.</p>

<p>Snack #1 &ndash; 2:30PM</p>
<p>Some<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/sweet-potato-banana-bites/" target="_blank">Sweet Potato Bites</a></strong></span>. I made this batch with fresh cranberries mixed in instead of chocolate chips.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12381" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/snack2.jpg.jpg" alt="snack2.jpg An RD WIAW" width="478" height="511" title="An RD WIAW"></p>
<p>Snack #2 &ndash; Pre-workout fuel&nbsp;- 4:00PM</p>
<p>A handful of goldfish + half a banana (I usually split my bananas with Tucker.)<br>
Plus water.</p>
<p>Then I walked the dogs 2 miles + did <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://instagram.com/p/oMWyWfPP_R/" target="_blank">this workout</a></strong>&nbsp;</span>in the garage. Typically when I workout, I go to Crossfit at either 4:30 or 5:30 but yesterday&rsquo;s class wasn&rsquo;t the best for a pregnant lady so I modified one of the workouts they did last week on one of my rest days so I could do it at home.</p>

<p>Snack #3- Post-workout refuel &ndash; 5:30PM</p>
<p>Salmon Sweet Potato Quinoa Cakes + allll the water</p>
<p>The salmon cakes are similar to this recipe for my <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/tuna-quinoa-cakes/" target="_blank">Tuna Quinoa Cakes</a>, except I used frozen salmon that I cooked &amp; flaked instead of canned tuna, left out the yogurt and didn&rsquo;t really measure anything.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12383" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/snack4.jpg.jpg" alt="snack4.jpg An RD WIAW" width="478" height="470" title="An RD WIAW"></p>
<p>Snack #4 &ndash; 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Hard boiled egg + peanut butter + a small apple</p>
<p>After my workout I played with the dogs, took a shower, read for a while and took a short nap. When I woke up, hubby was mowing the lawn, but I was hungry so I ate. I only ended up eating about half the apple.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12384" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dinner.jpg.jpg" alt="dinner.jpg An RD WIAW" width="478" height="512" title="An RD WIAW"></p>
<p>Dinner &ndash; 9:00 PM</p>
<p>Whole wheat tortilla + <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/refreshed-black-bean-guacamole/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>black bean guacamole</strong></span></a> + chicken + bacon + cheese and a side of peppers</p>
<p>Eating this late is not unusual for us.&nbsp;We typically eat dinner around 8:30 or 9.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12387" src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/snack6.jpg.jpg" alt="snack6.jpg An RD WIAW" width="474" height="405" title="An RD WIAW"></p>
<p>Snack #5 &ndash; Bedtime snack &ndash; 11:30 PM</p>
<p>Cheerios + skim milk</p>
<p>I hate going to bed hungry so I almost always eat something before I go to bed. If I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll wake up in the middle of the night absolutely starving!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>So there you have it! A full day of eats. For the record&hellip;.I really wanted to get ice cream but it just got too late. Hubby promised it to me yesterday and then the day got away from us and we didn&rsquo;t get it then either. I WILL get some before the week is over <img src="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile An RD WIAW" class="wp-smiley" title="An RD WIAW"></p>
