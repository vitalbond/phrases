<div><p>Hi Friends!</p>
<p>Today I have another RD friend to introduce you to! Caroline from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.sweetfoodie.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Foodie</a></strong></span>&nbsp;&amp; I connected on twitter a couple of years ago&hellip;and then we were able to meet in person last year at FNCE, which was awesome! She&rsquo;s always been a huge supporter of my blog and she&rsquo;s doing big things of her own in the nutrition world&hellip;so I wanted to make sure you guys met her! I asked her to share a recipe with you guys and here&rsquo;s what she came up with. Prepare to drool!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Hi Lean Green Bean fans! I&rsquo;m Caroline, the Registered Dietitian Nutritionist and blogger at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.sweetfoodie.com/">Sweet Foodie</a></strong></span>, where I share recipes and tips on how to eat healthfully and feel your best. I believe that good nutrition should be guilt-free: cook from scratch when you can, shop smart, move more, eat well, and enjoy indulgences. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Lindsay&rsquo;s blog and the positive, supportive community that she&rsquo;s fostered here.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I&rsquo;m pro-indulgences. So, I took some inspiration from popular candy bars and transformed them into healthier, but still totally decadent, chocolate bark. I love bark because it satisfies a chocolate craving without needing to eat very much, and I make it with whole ingredients like bittersweet chocolate, nuts, brown rice cereal and dried fruit, so I feel good about sharing it with my friends and family. Sprinkled with dried fruit and nuts, it&rsquo;s a beautiful dessert served alongside hot tea or coffee or gift wrapped in cellophane. My parents and husband love the Krackel style bark the most. Actually, my parents call it &ldquo;baaahk&rdquo; with an emphasis on the Boston accent &ndash; go Sox!</p>
<p>Ok, so let&rsquo;s get to the recipes already, right? The Chunky and Krackel bark use slightly different ingredients, but the first three steps are the same.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Chunky Bark</b></span></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>10 ounces bittersweet chocolate<br>
1/3 cup of raisins<br>
1/3 cup of dry roasted peanuts, roughly chopped</p>
<p>Directions:</p>
<p>1. Roughly chop the chocolate<br>
2. Cover a sheet pan or jellyroll pan with parchment paper<br>
3. In a microwave safe bowl, microwave the chocolate at 15-second intervals, stirring in between, until melted (about 1 minute 15 seconds total) [my preferred method!]. Alternatively, add water to the bottom part of a double boiler so the water is about 1/2 inch away from the top pot. Melt the chocolate slowly in over low heat, stirring frequently.<br>
4. Pour chocolate mixture onto sheet pan and spread with an&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">offset spatula</span>&nbsp;(a regular spatula works fine too &ndash; offset makes it easier) to desired thinness.<br>
5. Sprinkle raisins and peanuts on top. Press them gently into the chocolate to set.<br>
6. Let chocolate harden for 2 hours on the countertop or in the refrigerator. Cut or break into pieces and store in the refrigerator.</p>
