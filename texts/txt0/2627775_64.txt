<div><p>Sony has announced that they plan to start the Beta Test for&nbsp;their Playstation Now service tomorrow.&nbsp; The Playstation Now service, first announced alongside the Playstation 4 and detailed in depth at this year&rsquo;s CES, allows gamers to play earlier generation Playstation games through an online streaming service without any need for a console.&nbsp; It can be integrated into all currently operational Playstation platforms (including the Vita), tablets, smartphones, and the next generation Bravia HDTV.</p>
