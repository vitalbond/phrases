<div><p>The music from the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series&nbsp;is considered by many to be some of the finest music ever written for video games.&nbsp; Much of it has been rereleased through fan compilations, or covered by professionals.&nbsp; Heck, Video Games Live chose to include a track from <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> to start off&nbsp;their Level 3 Album.&nbsp; I mean, the battle fanfare&nbsp;is so well known people have&nbsp;used it as their&nbsp;ringtones!</p>
<p>To celebrate all the music over the course of the 20+ years of this incredible franchise, Square Enix released <em>THEATRHYTHM: Final Fantasy</em> for iOS and 3DS several years ago.&nbsp; It included tracks from each of the thirteen main <em>Final Fantasy</em> games and a ton of unlockable special features.&nbsp; Recently, I dug through every retailer I could just so I could find a copy of the game, and was really happy I did.</p>
<p>However, by only including songs from the main thirteen games, Square Enix missed out on the chance to include the tracks they produced for several <em>Final Fantasy</em> spin off games, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;songs from more recent releases like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>or<em> Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII.&nbsp; </em>To remedy this, Square Enix has been working on the first official sequel to the <em>THEATRHYTHM</em> series, <em>THEATRHYTHM: Final Fantasy Curtain Call</em>, but up until today we believed this game would only be released in Japan.</p>
<p>Today, I am proud to announced that Square Enix has revealed their plans to release <em>THEATRHYTHM: Final Fantasy Curtain Call</em> in North America this year.&nbsp; Take a look!</p>
