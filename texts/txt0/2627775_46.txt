<div><p>Can you believe its been over a year since&nbsp;we released the documentary &ldquo;Waiting for Halo 4&Prime;?&nbsp; For those of you who haven&rsquo;t seen it, it detailed&nbsp;the excruciating five year wait between the release of <em>Halo 3</em> and <em>Halo 4.</em>&nbsp; It was pretty well received by the people who watched it, and in fact, one of the commentators requested that we release it on DVD or Blu-Ray Disc.&nbsp; While we can&rsquo;t release the film on disc,&nbsp;we&nbsp;certainly have the ability to release&nbsp;special features&nbsp;for the&nbsp;documentary on the web&nbsp;for anyone to&nbsp;see.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, one year after it&rsquo;s release, Maniac has recorded a complete audio commentary track.&nbsp; Check it out.</p>
