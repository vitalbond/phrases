<div><p>It looks like EA wants to finally get their users an excuse to download their Origin program, as they have decided to offer the original <em>Dead Space</em> for free .&nbsp; I honestly consider the original&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em> to be one of the best games of 2008, which is quite an impressive feat as it came up against other major titles that year including <em>Resistance 2</em>, <em>Mirror&rsquo;s Edge</em>,&nbsp;and <em>Gears of War 2</em>.&nbsp; EA threw a lot of weight behind marketing this game, releasing an animated&nbsp;graphic novel series online, and a full length animated feature called <em>Dead Space: Downfall</em>&nbsp;on DVD and Blu-Ray that was pretty great.&nbsp; However, EA was actively including anti-consumer DRM in all of their PC games that year, and because of that, I consciously decided not to buy the game on PC, and instead picked up the console version of the game.</p>
<p>That said, once I did finally play the game, I found it incredibly enjoying.&nbsp; In fact, I actually listed its opening in my list of&nbsp;the <a title="The Best Game Openings Ever" href="http://gamexcess.net/2011/12/20/the-best-game-openings-ever/" target="_blank">Best Game Openings Ever</a>.&nbsp; If you have a PC and an Origin account, you really should give the game a look!</p>
<p>You will need to download the Origin client to play the game.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t have it currently installed, you can install it here.&nbsp; You will also need to create an Origin account, but&nbsp;if you already have an Origin account through EA (for games like <em>Sim City, Battlefield 4</em> or <em>Simpsons: Tapped Out</em>), you will be able to use it to download the game.&nbsp; The game should continue to be available to purchase&nbsp;free until the month of May, but once you do purchase it, it will be yours to play forever.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7058/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7058/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7058&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
