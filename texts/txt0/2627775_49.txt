<div><p>The biggest release this summer for the Wii U is undoubtably Mario Kart 8, the newest installment in the same franchise which has seen a release for the SNES, N64, GBA, GC and 3DS.</p>
<p>But just what will the game be bringing to the table?  Since the game was made playable across the country during last year&rsquo;s E3, we haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of new information about the game.  Today, that ends.  Check out the video below.</p>

<p>Any player who registers the game on <a href="http://club.nintendo.com/">Club Nintendo</a> before July 31st, 2014 will get the chance to download a selected game for free through the Wii U Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Mario Kart 8 is coming May 30th, 2014 exclusive to the Wii U.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7126/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7126/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7126&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
