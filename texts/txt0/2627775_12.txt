<div><p>I think I may actually be breaking news about this tonight. Xbox One can now natively stream gameplay (with microphone and video commentary from the Kinect) from the new Xbox One Twitch.TV app.  This feature was made possible with the recent Xbox One firmware update, but it required an updated Twitch.TV app to enable the feature. Today, that app is now live, and Xbox One owners can start broadcasting their games immediately.  Just update your Twitch.TV app on your Xbox One, or download it now from the Xbox Live App Store if you do not yet have it installed.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of how to stream your gameplay.</p>

<p>All you will need is a free Twitch.TV account to stream your gameplay.
