<div><p>Happy St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day!  Starting today, Xbox Live Gold Members can download the full unlocked version of the Xbox Live Arcade title <em>Dungeon Defenders</em> free of charge thanks to Microsoft&rsquo;s Games with Gold.  So, that means that right now you can either download the full game free of charge, or if you already have a free trial copy of the game downloaded on your Xbox 360, upgrade it to the full version free of charge.</p>
<p><em>Dungeon Defenders</em> will remain free until the end of March 2014.  No announcements have been made yet for what games will be made free next month through the program, but we will keep you posted when that is announced.  Finally, just like with all Games with Gold titles, as long as you download the full version at any time by the end of the month, you won&rsquo;t lose access to the game if your Gold status expires.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7028/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7028/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7028&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
