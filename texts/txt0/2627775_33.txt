<div><p>Anyone who participated in the <a title="All God of War: Ascension Multiplayer DLC Free Until April 1st" href="http://gamexcess.net/2014/03/26/all-god-of-war-ascension-multiplayer-dlc-free-until-april-1st/" target="_blank">God of War: Ascension One Year Anniversary Forum Thread</a> with the intention to receive download codes for two exclusive items for their multiplayer champion, can expect download codes for the content in their e-mails soon.&nbsp; Sony Santa Monica was overwhelmed by the response by players who wanted to get their hands on this content, and because of that, it has taken a bit more time then they were expecting to give the content to everyone who participated in the forum thread.</p>
<p>Everyone who did participate in the forum thread should expect download codes e-mailed to them by this weekend, or early next week at the very latest.&nbsp; Sony Santa Monica does confirm this content is exclusive only to people who participated in this event and will not be offered on the Playstation Store.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7073/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7073/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7073&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
