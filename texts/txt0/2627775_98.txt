<div><p>Since we upgraded to the Playstation 4, Maniac has been experimenting with doing live game streams on Twitch.TV with full picture in picture commentary for the website and has been quite pleased with the response.</p>
<p>So for anyone who visits the site on a regular basis, we would like to announce that we have established our own live game stream panel on <a title="Twitch.TV" href="http://www.twitch.tv/maniac536" target="_blank">Twitch.TV</a>.  The link can permanently be found under the Blogroll menu in the site’s lower right hand column.</p>
<p>If you’re a Twitch.TV member, be sure to subscribe to the channel to get the most up to date notifications on when we go live.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7272/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7272/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&#38;blog=12380894&#38;post=7272&#38;subd=gamexcess&#38;ref=&#38;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
