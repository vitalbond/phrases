<div><p>As promised, UbiSoft released the official smartphone companion app for their hit game <em>Watch_Dogs</em> on the day of the game&rsquo;s official release.&nbsp; The app, <a title="Watch Dogs Companion App Detailed" href="https://gamexcess.net/2012/06/13/watch-dogs-companion-app-detailed/" target="_blank">as originally detailed</a>, allows you a deeper level of connectivity with the game, allowing you to manipulate the game in real time.&nbsp; With the app, you can keep track of your friends from your mobile phone, unlock more abilities for yourself in-game, and do a whole lot more.</p>
<p>The <em>Watch Dogs</em> app can work from any internet connection, so you can play from either&nbsp;a cellular connection or through your home&nbsp;WiFi.&nbsp;&nbsp;The app works by connecting you through your Ubisoft&nbsp;Uplay account.&nbsp; Your game console or&nbsp;PC&nbsp;must be connected to the internet in order to use the app.</p>
<p>Sadly, when I attempted to use the app just before posting this news, I was unable to log in.&nbsp; I believe that Ubisoft is having some issues with Uplay this morning, and without a stable Uplay connection, you won&rsquo;t be able to use the app.&nbsp; I will continue to monitor Uplay through the day and will keep you guys updated when the service is restored.</p>
<p>iPhone users can download the Compaion App right now through&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s App Store.&nbsp; It weighs in at around 45 MB in size.&nbsp; It should also be out for Android phones as well.&nbsp; The download is completely free of charge.</p>
<p><em>Watch Dogs</em> is out now for the PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.&nbsp; A Wii U version will be coming later this year.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:  At around 5:45pm EST the Uplay login servers have started to allow connections. However, players are still being randomly disconnected from the service.  Because of this there are still some players having issues playing the game on PC.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7191/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7191/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7191&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
