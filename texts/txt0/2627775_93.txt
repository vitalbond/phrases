<div><p>The creators of <em>Halo</em> are hard at work creating their next major franchise, and many gamers out there believe that their next game, <em>Destiny</em>, could be the biggest multiplatform hit of the year.  This weekend, Sony and Bungie have teamed up to host an exclusive Alpha Test for the Playstation 4 version of the game, and we got a good look at it.</p>
<p>The Alpha Test starts off with an initial setup screen, character and class creation, and a love letter from Bungie themselves.  If you’re not in the <em>Destiny</em> Alpha, this could be your first actual peek at the game.  All footage was captured from the Playstation 4′s internal DVR.</p>

<p>Not enough for you?  Don’t worry!  More footage from the <em>Destiny</em> Alpha is on the way.</p>
