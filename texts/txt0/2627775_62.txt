<div><p>Interceptor Entertainment and 3D Realms have announced today that they are currently developing an all new Action/RPG they are calling <em>Bombshell</em>.&nbsp; From up close, the game looks like it is the start of an entirely new IP, but those of you who are familiar with <em>Duke Nukem Forever&rsquo;s</em> development (or saw my retrospective on <a title="What Was Cut from Duke Nukem Forever" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrrtJQPdSoI" target="_blank">What Was Cut from <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em></a>) know that Bombshell was originally designed by 3D Realms during <em>Duke Nukem Forever&rsquo;s</em> development to be a secondary playable character.&nbsp; While she never appeared in any form in the final version of that game, it looks like the guys at 3D Realms haven&rsquo;t forgotten her.</p>
<p>Well, or they wanted to make a new Duke Nukem game, couldn&rsquo;t, and put Bombshell in it instead.</p>

<p>Interceptor also released this Behind the Scenes video about the game&rsquo;s development.&nbsp; In it, they talk about the initial ideas behind the game (which I already wrote about) and the studio&rsquo;s plans for the future</p>
