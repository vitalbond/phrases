<div><p>There is little doubt that <em>The Last of Us</em> was Sony&rsquo;s best exclusive title last year.&nbsp; Developed by Naughty Dog, the same studio which brought the PS3 exclusive <em>Uncharted</em> series, <em>The Last of Us</em> was less of an action adventure and more of a dramatic character story.</p>
<p>Now it looks like Sony plans to rerelease this game on the Playstation 4, and this new PS4 edition of the game will be called <em>The Last of Us Remastered</em>.  As one would expect from a next generation port of a previous generation game, it will include all of the game&rsquo;s DLC, native 1080p support (the original game was in 720p) and improved graphics.  However, it will also include a feature we have not seen before.  The <em>Remastered</em> game will include a commentary track for all of the game&rsquo;s cutscenes featuring guys from Naughty Dog and the lead actors!</p>
<p>No word on a definite release date has been provided, but Sony says we can expect the game to be rereleased this summer. Fans of retail establishments will also be happy to know that the Remastered Edition will get a retail release as well as a digital one.  Anyone who preorders the game through a participating retailer will get a whole set of XP perks and exclusive clothing for single player.</p>
<p>Seriously this really was a great game and I would recommend it to any PS4 owner who never had the chance to play it on the PS3. If you want to know just how intense this game&rsquo;s development actually was, check out the official documentary on the making of the game, <em>Grounded</em>.</p>
