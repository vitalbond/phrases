<div><p>Continuing with our <em>Metal Gear</em> coverage this week to celebrate the release of <em>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</em>, Maniac cracks open <em>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</em> on the Xbox One.&nbsp; The Xbox One and Xbox 360 versions of the game include an exclusive mission starring Raiden, the hero of <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> and <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em>.&nbsp; Playstation players get their own exclusive mission, called &ldquo;Deja Vu&rdquo;.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s crack it open and see what is included in the $30 game.</p>

<p>I commend Konami for including all of the game&rsquo;s content (including the platform exclusive bonus mission) on the game&rsquo;s disc, and not forcing players to redeem download codes.&nbsp; Also, take a look at the box,&nbsp;Konami promises some exclusive content for any player who later on picks up <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em>.&nbsp; Since the game offers no codes, it is highly likely that <em>The Phantom Pain</em> will use some other type of way to unlock the game&rsquo;s exclusive content, such as a game data or save file from <em>Ground Zeroes</em>.</p>
<p><em>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</em> is out now for the PS3, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7032/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7032/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7032&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
