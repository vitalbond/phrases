<div><p>Our friends over at <a href="http://youtube.com/batinthesun">Bat in the Sun</a> have done it again.  In the latest episode of their critically acclaimed webseries <em>Super Power Beat Down</em>, they decided to take two iconic products of two very different programs designed to make the perfect super soldier.</p>
<p>On the one side, hailing from video games, Master Chief John-117.  The Master Chief is the hero of the <em>Halo</em> franchise, one of the biggest new franchises of the past decade and has saved the galaxy from not only an intergalactic alien army, but an alien parasite infestation which could have wiped out all life in the galaxy.  His opponent, coming from the pages of Marvel Comics, is Captain Steve Rogers, a man known better as Captain America.  Brandishing an indestructible shield, he punched Adolf Hitler in the face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super soldier vs super soldier. Who will win?  Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>
