<div><p>In honor of the first anniversary of the release of <em>God of War: Ascension</em> on the Playstation 3, Sony Santa Monica has announced that all multiplayer downloadable content items for the game will be free to download until April 1st.&nbsp; That includes all special armor, tattoos, and weapons that you can customize your multiplayer champion with.&nbsp; The only thing that hasn&rsquo;t been made free are the Double XP bonuses, but they are at a reduced price right now, and if you choose to download the complete multiplayer DLC pack (which is also free with the promotion), you should get a limited time&nbsp;Double XP voucher along with it.</p>
<p>Finally, Sony Santa Monica is giving away an exclusive item to anyone who participates in <a title="Playstation Forums" href="http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/God-of-War-Ascension-Multiplayer/Get-quot-The-Marked-One-quot-Tat-amp-Studio-Cape/td-p/43205834" target="_blank">this forum post</a>.&nbsp; Anyone who enters an answer will get e-mailed a download code for two exclusive items, the Marked One Tattoo, and Studio Cape, which will never be available to purchase or download again after this promotion concludes.&nbsp; So click the link and post your answer!</p>
<p>The cool thing about <em>God of War: Ascension&rsquo;s</em> downloadable content is that there&rsquo;s really nothing extra to download.&nbsp; Once you purchase or redeem downloadable content for the game, it is automatically tied to your Playstation Network account, and will become unlocked in your game without the need to download anything extra to your Playstation 3 Hard Drive.</p>
<p><em>God of War: Ascension</em> is out now exclusively to the Playstation 3.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7046/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7046/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7046&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
