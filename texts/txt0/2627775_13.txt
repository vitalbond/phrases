<div><p>A quick notice for Apple Device owners that Apple quietly released iOS 7.1 today to the iPhone and iPad. The new iOS update includes a slew of new features including CarPlay, improved HDR photo settings on iPhone 5s, performance on iPhone 4, and several more bug fixes.</p>
<p>Check your iDevice&rsquo;s software update feature to see if your device is compatible with iOS 7.1. If you are planning to update your handheld on its own without connecting it to iTunes through your PC or Mac, it is about a 250MB download, depending on your device and how recent its software is.  It also requires 2.5GB of free space.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to update the device though iTunes, you must download a 1.5GB update file on your computer, but you will not need 2.5GB of free space on your device.   Make sure you have the most recent version of iTunes installed before performing the update.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7022/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7022/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7022&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
