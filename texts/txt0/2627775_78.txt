<div><p>Just before E3, Square Enix has released their latest official trailer for <em>Kingdom Hearts HD II.5 ReMIX</em>.  This game will include fully updated HD versions of the PS2 hit <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> and the PSP <em>Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep</em>, retooled specifically for the Playstation 3.  Finally, as a bonus, it will include a newly produced cinematic retelling of the game <em>Kingdom Hearts RE: Coded</em>, which was originally released to mobile platforms and the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>How will these games look?  Take a look for yourselves.  Oh and pay close attention to the ending. There&rsquo;s a quick teaser at the end for <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how excited I am for this rerelease. <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> was my favorite game in the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series, and Square Enix has promised that like they had with the earlier HD ReMIX, they will be bringing the updated versions of the game which only saw a release in Japan.  The updated games include new areas, bosses, and a lot more.  Secondly, never having a Nintendo DS or a compatible cell phone, I was never able to play the game <em>Kingdom Hearts RE: Coded</em>.  It will be nice to finally see that game&rsquo;s story in all new cimematics.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Hearts HD II.5 ReMIX</em> is coming December 2nd, 2014 exclusive to the Playstation 3.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7216/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7216/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7216&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
