<div><p>Sony has just released a required update for the PS4 in the form of firmware 1.71. Sony&rsquo;s release notes mention that the update adds no new features but improves the system stability during certain tasks.</p>
<p>Could this update be in response to the PS4 corruption error that put my PS4 in the shop for almost a month?  Post a comment with your thoughts.</p>
<p>Firmware 1.71 is required to connect to PSN.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7207/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamexcess.wordpress.com/7207/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamexcess.net&amp;blog=12380894&amp;post=7207&amp;subd=gamexcess&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
