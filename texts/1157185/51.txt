<div><p>Fashion is an art. Art requires creativity, and creativity is always accompanied by risk.</p>
<p>For a brief time in high school, &ldquo;street style&rdquo; was my middle name. I was coming into my own realm of fashion, and all of those hours of watching <em>What Not to Wear</em>&nbsp;and <em>How Do I Look?</em>&nbsp; were finally paying off. I started wearing items that caused me to look in the mirror, nod my head, and say, &ldquo;Now that, looks like me!&rdquo; I wore shorts over leggings before everyone thought it was cool and would sometimes look through my closet and think, <em>&ldquo;What unexpected things can I put together today?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-72801  aligncenter" alt="Fashionable People" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Style-collage.jpg" width="580" height="290"></p>
<p>I also started thrift shopping and took it one step further by trading a bland gray sweater vest with my eleven year old sister for a pink sparkly belt to wear around my waist. I also got to the point where my mom, who is a pretty stylish lady, would tell me that she didn&rsquo;t like something, but I wore it anyway because I liked it and that was all that mattered. These items included purple tights and a pink over-sized sweater she thought looked like Pepto Bismol.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the murky transition between adolescence and almost-adulthood, that all got lost. I&rsquo;m officially fashionably restless. I&rsquo;m tired of cardigans, blouses, basic T&rsquo;s and mindless combinations. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love classic staples and wouldn&rsquo;t dream of chaotically-assembled patterns or dressing like a crazy person. But if we have to wear clothes everyday, we might as well have fun with it.</p>

While not everything on the runway is made to wear, here are some examples from the runway to use for inspiration.</p>
<p>In the morning, open your closet with fresh eyes. Be creative, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to go outside of the box. After all, fashionable people take risks!</p>
