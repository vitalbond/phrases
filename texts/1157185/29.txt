<p>WOW!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only word I can think of that accurately describes the new <a href="http://www.electroluxappliances.com/Homecare/Vacuum-Cleaners/Lightweight-Vacuum-Cleaners/EL3000A.aspx" target="_blank">Electrolux UltraPower Studio Vacuum</a>!&nbsp; How such a small and compact machine can suck up so much &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; out of a carpet is unbelievable.&nbsp; The fact that it runs on long lasting battery power makes it even more of a pleasure to use&hellip;.. no cords to move from wall receptacles as one goes from room to room.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72352" alt="Electrolux UltraPower Studio Vacuum" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Electrolux.jpg" width="580" height="580"></p>
<p>Our family has been using Electrolux vacuums for over 75 years, and I can remember being the &ldquo;chosen one&rdquo; who had to drag the heavy canister up the stairs to clean the carpet on each step when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Later after I was married, we purchased our own Electrolux canister, and with all of the attachments and the long hose, cleaning a one-story ranch-style home was no problem.&nbsp; It was the most effective cleaner on both the carpet and the brick that ran down the hallways and in the dining room.</p>
<p>When we moved into the condominium, I chose an upright Electrolux, which was easy to use, but didn&rsquo;t get into the smaller areas that needed attention, and I might add that we now were the proud owners of a very lovable, but shedding Golden Retriever.&nbsp; This meant having to do extra cleaning in areas where the vacuum did not reach.</p>
<p>That is the beauty of this outstanding new Electrolux Studio Vacuum. It not only picks up all of the dog fur that seems to multiply each day on the carpet, but it also works just as efficiently on the tile floors on the entry, dining room and kitchen.&nbsp; It is the first appliance I&rsquo;ve had that didn&rsquo;t scatter the loose fur, but rather sucked up every bit in the area.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so simple to make a quick swipe around the kitchen after a day of cooking, again picking up anything that happens to drop on the floor.</p>
<p>Another great feature is that it can basically lay flat while running, therefore cleaning under most furniture, beds and dressers that used to require special attention from added attachments.&nbsp; The easy-to-empty dirt collection container can be removed quickly, emptied into the trash, and be back on the vacuum in a brief time, ready to move on to the next area of the condo.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the small size of this Electrolux UltraPower Studio Vacuum!&nbsp; It is much more efficient than any previous machine I have ever owned&hellip;. cleaning more deeply on the carpets and gathering up anything that happens to be on the bare floors.&nbsp; The extra good news is that it&rsquo;s lightweight and can basically be pushed away with one touch of the hand.&nbsp; The charging stand that comes with it can easily be hidden in a closet, and the vacuum is ready to grab whenever there is a need to clean.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Electrolux!&nbsp; This UltraPower Studio Vacuum is decidedly the vacuum of the future.&nbsp; I have raved about it to my friends who seem to be most interested in a smaller but more efficient cleaning machine.&nbsp; I am back to my original impression&hellip;.WOW!</p>
