<div><p>With the coming and going of Memorial Day, we have officially kicked off the summer season.&nbsp; That means BBQ&rsquo;s and beach trips, but before you run off to bury your toes in the sand, make sure you are fully prepared with these beach essentials.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73841" alt="Beach---ChicGalleria" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Beach-ChicGalleria.jpg" width="580" height="176"></p>
<p><b><i>Lather Up</i></b></p>
<p>The first and most important item for your bag is sunblock with an SPF of 15 or higher, with a separate sunblock for your face and lips (check out the one manufactured by <a href="http://www.neutrogena.com/product/revitalizing+lip+balm+spf+20.do">Neutrogena</a>).&nbsp; Look for a brand that is water and sweat resistant. Remember to reapply for those long beach days.</p>
<p><b><i>Spread Out</i></b></p>
<p>An oversized beach towel is another essential &ndash; especially if you do not have a beach chair. Finding a cheap, yet cute option is easy at department stores like your local Target, K-Mart and Walmart. You&rsquo;re sure to find something that fits your style.</p>
<p><b><i>Drink Up</i></b></p>
<p>Bring a big bottle of water with you to the beach! Spending hours in the hot sun and salty air calls for some extra hydration. Another thing to remember is that dehydration is sometimes confused with hunger, so be aware.</p>
<p><b><i>Eye Safety</i></b></p>
<p>Be sure to shield your eyes from the bright sun with a good pair of sunglasses.&nbsp; You want them to have a UV protection of 400 or higher.</p>
<p><b><i>Know the Time</i></b></p>
<p>Keep track of time with a waterproof or water-resistant watch.&nbsp; You can go with something sporty or stylish, but make sure that it is a brand that can get a little wet without getting damaged. Brands like Invicta, found <a href="http://www.shophq.com/SearchM/Default.aspx?category=Watches%7Ct311&amp;prop=Invicta%7C483">here</a>, carry several options that are both trendy and can handle various rugged climates and activities.</p>
<p><b><i>Take a Selfie</i></b></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to capture the fun you had in the sun so don&rsquo;t forget to bring a camera!&nbsp; In this day in age many of us have camera phones, but if you really want quality pictures bring a digital one. This brings up a second point: pack a bag to protect your electronics from getting water damaged. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.academy.com/shop/browse/camping-outdoors-rain-gear-waterproof-bags-containers/_/N-116389099">Academy.com</a> has affordable waterproof bags that will protect items the size of your phone all the way up to your laptop. These types of bags are super convenient for boating trips.</p>
<p><b><i>Be a Bookworm</i></b></p>
<p>While people watching is a great form of beach entertainment, a good book is a must to keep occupied.&nbsp; Trashy novels fall under a popular category for beach-worthy reading. Mystery books are another worthy option. While you might be tempted to bring your tablet, there&rsquo;s no denying that there&rsquo;s something especially satisfying about &ldquo;turning the page.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Rock Out</i></b></p>
<p>Bring some tunes if you want to take a nap without disturbance! Listen on your headphones or invest in a set of waterproof speakers so you and your friends can enjoy together.</p>
<p><b><i>Eat, Eat, Eat!</i></b></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to grab some grub!&nbsp; Pack a cooler with some delicious snacks such as nut bars, trail mix, and fresh fruit; food that is offered on the boardwalk tends to be costly and unhealthy. Once your stomach starts rumbling you&rsquo;ll be happy you planned ahead.</p>
<p>You want to make the most out of your vacation time, and with these essentials, you are ready for a fantastic beach day that will last hours on end.&nbsp; Just remember to hydrate, reapply sunscreen, and be sure to laugh!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s summertime, and the living is easy!</p>
