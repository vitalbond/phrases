<div><p>Mother&rsquo;s Day is a symbolic day when I honor my mom and my kids honor me. Actually, it&rsquo;s a day when mom and I get together, ditch the kids, have lunch and go to the annual Tulsa Designer Showcase house tour. We&rsquo;ve made this a tradition each year and it&rsquo;s definitely a guilty pleasure. Mom and I get to spend quality time together while touring a gorgeously decorated home and dream of granite countertops, marble fireplaces&nbsp;and crystal chandeliers.</p>

<p>And the best part of this whole day is simply sharing time with each other. Granted we do keep our phones, just to make sure there are no problems at home.&nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that a required action for all mothers?</p>
<p>The thought of receiving a fantastic new phone, the HTC One&reg; (M8) from Verizon would certainly make&nbsp;my day even better. After reading so much about this phone, I would think that there are moms everywhere who are eager to drop strong hints about&nbsp;the desire for this HTC One&reg; (M8), and are leaving less than subtle messages around the house for all family members to read.</p>
<p>I can only imagine the fun I&rsquo;ll have snapping photos of my kids, much to their dismay. With the ability to record 30-second video clips in 1080p HD, I can&rsquo;t wait to film my daughter&rsquo;s many humorous faces that I swear will make her the next Emma Stone. I know my son will immediately snatch the HTC One&reg; (M8) away while my mom and I are out touring the newly decorated show house. No doubt, he will add all my favorite music to the HTC One&reg; (M8) so I can listen wirelessly through the car. I know I&rsquo;ll enjoy the HTC BoomSound &trade; with the built-in amplifiers and Beats Audio &trade; once I&rsquo;m settled on the couch at home that evening. When I&rsquo;m not listening to Pearl Jam or the Dave Matthews Band, I&rsquo;ll be able to use my HTC One&reg; (M8) as a TV remote. Using Sense TV&trade;, I can just flip through channels, access program guides, adjust the volume and more. It will even alert me when my favorite shows are on. I think I&rsquo;ll customize my home screen with HTC BlinkFeed&trade; so I can update my social media feeds so I can see what all my friends are doing on Mother&rsquo;s Day. Plus, it won&rsquo;t destroy their budgets at only $99 ($100 off!). New 2 year activation required.</p>
<p>With my kids surprising me with the new HTC One&reg; (M8) from Verizon (<a href="http://vzw.com/bestdeals" target="_blank">vzw.com/bestdeals</a>), my Mom and I enjoying a quiet lunch, and spending the evening on the couch with my family, Mother&rsquo;s Day will be exactly what I want it to be. I love my family and being a mother.</p>
