<p>Lucky for you, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of nonsurgical techniques that are designed to reduce wrinkles, lines and blemishes, as well improve your skin&rsquo;s overall tone and texture. Keep reading to find out which treatment is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Microdermabrasion</b></p>
<p>Microdermabrasion techniques are designed to reveal healthy, <a href="http://www.chicgalleria.com/2014/04/makeup-monday-get-glowing-skin-with-facial-radiance-pads/">glowing skin</a> by sloughing off the outermost layer of the epidermis. Performed with tools or products that gently exfoliate skin cells, microdermabrasion offers benefits like reduced lines and wrinkles, enhanced skin tone, reduced acne and sun spots, and skin that&rsquo;s more receptive to moisturizing creams and treatments. These treatments can also lessen the appearance of scars, and require little to no recovery time.</p>
<p>Microdermabrasion can be performed both at home and in professional settings. At-home treatments usually involve the use of buffing gels or creams, as well as followup treatments that moisturize and promote healing. Professional treatments are administered through the use of tools that exfoliate the skin&rsquo;s surface, then collect the leftover skin cells to reveal healthier, brighter skin.</p>
<p>This technique can be used by anyone looking to enhance the skin&rsquo;s tone and texture, but is most effective in individuals with sun damage, minor scars, mild acne and dull-looking skin.</p>
<p><b>Laser Hair Removal</b></p>
<p>For many women, facial hair removal is a must. The time-consuming tasks of plucking, shaving, tweezing and waxing play a major role in our beauty rituals, and often have to be repeated on a weekly, or even daily, basis. Plus, at-home hair removal often comes at the price of reddening, irritation, razor burn and other unsightly effects. Laser therapies, however, can be used to remove unwanted hair, safely and permanently, without embarrassing side effects.</p>
<p>According to the American Laser Skincare in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.americanlaser.com/clinic-locations/alamo-heights.php">downtown San Antonio</a>, laser hair removal works by using intense light therapies&nbsp;to destroy hair follicles in the targeted areas. The skin surrounding the targeted areas is left unharmed, and most customers describe a relatively painless experience. What&rsquo;s more, these methods can be used on most areas of the body, including the face, arms, legs and bikini area. With laser hair removal, unwanted hair is permanently removed, safely and effectively, in as little as a few treatment sessions.</p>
<p><b>Fraxel Laser Therapies</b></p>
<p>Fraxel laser treatments are used to reduce wrinkles and spotting, treat acne and enhance skin tone, as well as boost the skin&rsquo;s production of collagen. The effects include firmer, brighter, younger-looking skin, in as little as one or two treatment sessions.</p>
<p>Fraxel works by penetrating the deeper layers of the skin, repairing blemishes and reversing the signs of aging, while leaving the outer layer of the skin intact. Most customers report side effects that include reddening and irritation, as well as tightening and a sensation akin to mild sunburn. Recovery times vary, but usually range from one to five days. For optimal results, up to five treatments are necessary, with a healing time of one month between sessions.</p>
<p>This method works on most skin types, and provides the best results to individuals with sun spots, fine lines and wrinkles, uneven skin tone and/or aging, sagging skin.</p>
<p><b>Chemical Peels</b></p>
<p>Chemical peels involve the use of powerful chemicals, which are applied to the outermost layer of the skin. These chemicals cause skin cells to blister and peel away, revealing fresher, brighter, blemish-free skin. Other benefits include reduced wrinkles and age spots, a more even skin tone, fewer blemishes and reduced appearance of scars.</p>
<p>Although chemical peels are often effective on all types of skin, individuals with lighter skin tones may experience better results. Plus, since certain medications and habits may interfere with the chemical process, disclosing full medical and lifestyle history prior to receiving treatment is essential. Chemical peels are often associated with side effects like extreme tightness, redness and irritation, which typically heal within two to five days.</p>
<p><b>Cosmetic Fillers</b></p>
<p>Not to be confused with Botox (which treats wrinkles by relaxing the muscles beneath the skin), <a href="http://www.aboutplasticsurgery.com/skin/dermal-fillers/dermal-fillers-risks/">cosmetic filler injections</a>&nbsp;actually fill the spaces caused by wrinkles and lines with various types of substances. In effect, lines and wrinkles are significantly less noticeable, with some disappearing altogether. These effects typically last up to one year, after which the treatments can be administered again.</p>
<p>Although types of fillers vary, the most commonly used include&nbsp;hyaluronic acid, collagen and synthetic fillers. Good candidates for cosmetic filler injection include those with wrinkles or fine lines around the eyes or mouth, as well as those with dark circles or bags under the eyes. Since fillers can result in complications like allergic reaction and other risks, these treatments should always be administered by a doctor in a medical setting.</p>
<p>And there you have it: everything you need to know about the most popular nonsurgical skin-enhancing treatments. Now that you know more about these skincare techniques, you&rsquo;re better equipped to choose the one that best suits your individual needs. Good luck on your quest to healthy, glowing, beautiful skin!</p>
