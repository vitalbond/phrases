<div><p>One thing that every office worker worries about is the mess that&rsquo;s left behind after the lunch break. Most of us tend to go to a designated lunch hall or local fast food retailer, that way should we make a mess, we&rsquo;ll remain relatively anonymous.</p>
<p>But for those unfortunate people, who are stuck at their desk for lunch, there&rsquo;s no escaping the shame or the judging eyes as you try in vain to tidy up all those little crumbs leftover from your lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-73045" alt="computer" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dreamstime_4901799_0574.jpg" width="579" height="384"></p>
<p>Either scrolling through Facebook on your lunch break, checking out the latest news or just idly playing on a few Bingo sites (You can find information about bingo sites <a href="http://www.wheretoplaybingo.org/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At some point you&rsquo;re going to get careless and spill some of your lunch all over your nice clean desk.</p>
<p>And a dirty desk can lead you getting in trouble or worse, fired.</p>
<p>So with that in mind here&rsquo;s our choice of relatively tidy treats to have at your desk.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wraps and Burritos</span></b></p>
<p>These can be pay off well if you keep the foil and wrapper nearby and are pretty deft at keeping spillages to a minimum. Sandwiches tend to crumble after the first bite as much as wraps, but at least you can happily munch on any parts that fall out onto the wrapper that comes with your burrito or wrap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-73046" alt="fruit" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dreamstime_2579183_0531.jpg" width="580" height="385"></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fruits and Vegetables</span></b></p>
<p>Fruit and Vegetables tend to be an obvious choice because of how neat they are, plus there are the added <a href="http://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/">health benefits</a>.</p>
<p>The downside is they tend to get a little stale and boring to eat whilst staring at a screen all day. For a bit of excitement you could chop them up and eat them as slices or use a small sweet dip, just be careful it doesn&rsquo;t drip.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-73047" alt="nuts" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dreamstime_16355774.jpg" width="580" height="387"></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assorted Nuts </span></b></p>
<p>Although not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/health-benefits-nuts">nuts are incredibly healthy as a snack</a> and they cause the least amount of mess, well unless you have pistachios.</p>
<p>Just one ounce of nuts contains only 184 calories, a great source of energy and they&rsquo;re low in fat.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soups</span></b></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not suggesting go all out and have a bowl and spoon at the ready. Instead why not invest in a thermos or sealable mug that can be filled up with your soup of choice. That way you just unseal it and sip whilst sitting at your desk, as if it was one of your countless daily cups of coffee, no mess no fuss just a <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-health/recipes-to-make-your-own-soap-lotion-and-more.aspx">healthy lunch</a>.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soba Noodles</span></b></p>
<p>This is a great example for those that want an adventurous lunch.</p>
<p>Although it will take a bit of preparation during the night before, the benefit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soba">soba noodles</a> is that they tend to stay in the bowl if you spill them because of how much they stick together.</p>
<p>An added benefit is that it&rsquo;s a carbohydrate that will keep you going with a steady burst of energy throughout the day.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salad</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://iowagirleats.com/2013/11/01/10-healthy-salad-recipes/">Salads are a great healthy snack</a> and they leave the least amount of mess, as long as you don&rsquo;t absolutely drench them in oil.</p>
<p>Best of all it&rsquo;s usually comprised of a lot of large pieces of vegetables.</p>
<p>So should you accidently drop something it&rsquo;ll be large enough to quickly pick up without becoming a permanent addition to dark depths of your keyboard.</p>
