And no matter how busy we are, we all have 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Author, Lorne Holden shows us the amazing possibilities of 10 minutes with her book titled,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1479212474/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1479212474&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chicgall-20">MAKE IT HAPPEN in Ten Minutes a Day: The Simple, Lifesaving Method for Getting Things Done</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=chicgall-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1479212474" width="1" height="1" border="0">.&nbsp; </em>This little book took me an hour to read, and it&rsquo;s philosophy has been ringing in my head ever since.</p>
<p>During the weekend, I can be a huge procrastinator. I look at my to do list and instantly look the other way&ndash; to my bed. This past weekend was different. I kept thinking, &ldquo;Okay Chealsia, only ten minutes, you&rsquo;ll feel so much better if you just take 10 minutes.&rdquo; With that, I set the alarm on my phone, sat on the couch and knocked off one item on my to-do list. Most of the time, that ten minutes flew by, and I would keep going, just like Holden predicted.</p>
<p>Her guide book to what she calls &ldquo;a new relationship with your time and energy,&rdquo; is short, sweet and encouraging. Her words alongside inspiring quotes ease readers into accomplishing dreams and conquering weighty tasks. Just keep in mind the mantra: &ldquo;Make it easy, take it easy, keep it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other snippets that fuel her mode include looking at &ldquo;the time within the time,&rdquo; to maximize each moment. Taking care of &ldquo;the niggling thing&rdquo; (an annoying chore you just don&rsquo;t want to do) and staying open to the &ldquo;time bloom effect,&rdquo; the freedom to continue past the ten-minute mark.</p>
<p>Holden is not an author with a theoretical approach. This ten-minute model rings true in her own life. It&rsquo;s helped her garden again, write her will and write the book in my hands today.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have any overarching dreams pinpointed? Don&rsquo;t worry! Holden helps you brainstorm and tab into your inner desires to discover things you&rsquo;ve dismissed due to apparent impossibility. The end of the book includes specific ideas and a worksheet to help you organize goals into two sections: create and conquer. It also helps you look realistically at where you are, where you want to be and how long it will take you to get there.</p>
<p>The method also helps with the everyday, whether you just need to take ten minutes to be alone with your thoughts or want to engage your children in keeping the house clean. It&rsquo;s simple, accessible and flexible.</p>
<p>Lorne Holden will&nbsp; host a&nbsp;<a href="http://makeithappenintenminutesaday.com/seminar">three-week online coaching seminar</a> this Spring to help you implement this model in your life within an online community of support, encouragement, accountability and inspiration.</p>
<p>So make it easy, take it easy, keep it easy. Pick up the book, check out <a href="http://makeithappenintenminutesaday.tumblr.com/">the blog</a>, and start getting things done with the help of your new friend, Lorne Holden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely helping me.</p>
