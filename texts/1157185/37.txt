<p><a href="http://www.lushusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Lush-Site/en_US/Home-Show">LUSH</a>, the company that brings us soothing bath products, organic face washes and handmade smell goods that replenish our bodies, recently took things one step further. Now, not only do we get to experience the products, but at their LUSH Spa and store in New York, you can get a full body experience, both in the store and at home. The company also has plans to open 20 new stores this year, including openings in New Jersey, North Carolina and Tennessee this spring.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with LUSH, your body is missing out. In the chaos of everyday life, our bodies are often neglected. Sitting in an office, standing on your feet all day, and then collapsing in bed to start all over. But LUSH products add a little bit of beauty and indulgence to the everyday.</p>
<p>Their spa treatments are truly unique. The Synaesthesia is their signature Spa treatment, a multi-sensory 80 minute massage that can take you into one of eleven different emotional states that lead to complete relaxation. Whether you want ambition, esteem, confidence, energy, or more perspectives, the therapist will take you there by pairing the full body massage with &ldquo;birdsong, radiating color and clouds of scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You could also try The Comforter, described as a hot chocolate body scrub, or the Sound Bath, that clears your mind and helps you listen better&ndash; to your inner self. Or enjoy the Spell, a magical foot massage that includes a foot soak, scrub massage and scalp massage, eliminating your worries.</p>
<p>Whichever you try, your body is in for a real treat, because LUSH knows how to care for your body. If you are not familiar with LUSH, check out the store, and try some of their bestsellers. We guarantee you&rsquo;ll be hooked.</p>

<p>Some of our favorite, fresh handmade products are:</p>
<p><strong>Honey I Washed the Kids Soap<br></strong></p>
<p>Who knew a bar of soap could be so revitalizing? I didn&rsquo;t. Waking up every morning to shower with the scent of honey and caramel and a hint of citrus gets rid of all morning grogginess. The soft, smooth lather is infused with essential oils that heal, cleanse and calm irritated, tired skin. The beeswax at the bottom is a constant reminder of the naturalness of the product, as opposed to my generic body wash on the counter. After using this for a few weeks, there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean Salt Face and Body Scrub</strong></p>
<p>The bright blue salts and creamy undertones invigorate the skin while stimulating the senses with the smell of fresh grapefruit and fresh lime crushed in vodka (working to wash away excess oils). While your skin gets renewed and detoxified, you are also partaking in the bliss of a scrumptious fruity smell that leaves you wanting more. Be gone dead skin, this fresh scrub takes care of it all.</p>
<p>Speaking of taking care of your face, this clay-based cleanser with ground almonds gently exfoliates your skin. Just looking at the name on the tub makes you feel like heaven. It&rsquo;s a daily cleanser that you gently massage&nbsp; into your skin so that you are one step closer to angelic skin. It also smells fresh and clean, with hints of rose and lavender that balance out combination skin. It&rsquo;s soft, smooth and easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>Sex Bomb</strong></p>
<p>LUSH&rsquo;s bath bombs are a must-have for every woman that&rsquo;s on the the go or simply in need of a bit of revitalization and relaxation. The Sex Bomb is one of their best sellers. As my first bath bomb experience, the Sex Bomb took the cake. The purple and pink ball dropped in the water and spiraled around the tub, turning my bath a purplish-pink while filling my bathroom with sensual smells. The bath bomb includes jasmine, ylang ylang, and clary sage, which are powerful aphrodisiacs to ignite a romantic mood. When the bath bomb is dissolved, the water is softened, and you are free to soak in the luxury of a bath that is far from ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>Dream Cream</strong></p>
<p>This cream is a miracle in a jar. During the winter, my hands get really cracked. No matter how much lotion I put on in the morning, all I have to do is wash my hands once, and they crease up and get embarrassingly rough. Not with dream cream. I could feel this lightweight cream soothe my skin every time I used it. And the best part is that I only had to use it once a day, and my hands were soft as butter.&nbsp; The natural lotion contains chamomile, lavender and oat milk, and as it relaxed my angry skin, the smells relaxed me.</p>
<p>So, go to LUSH, or check out their <a href="http://www.lushusa.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Lush-Site/en_US/Home-Show" target="_blank">online store</a>. Believe me, your body will thank you!</p>
