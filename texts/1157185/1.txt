<div><p>Derived from the fashion capital of China, Fashion Shenzhen took on Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week by storm. To start out the show, Chinese design brand Ellassay took the lead by sending models of pure elegance, distinct urban style with luxurious quality of garments down the runway. Each look had modernity and feminine silhouettes. Flowing gowns and fitted dresses, to shirts and pant looks all were a part of the collection. It was just the right amount of modern looks mixed with glamorous, appealing classicism.</p>

<p>Once the Ellassay show ended, guests were about the stand up and leave until the lights went out. Strobe lights started flashing and club music started bursting out of the speakers. The audience was confused&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t the show over? We all looked around at each other and started laughing. &nbsp;No it was not over. The lights dimmed back on, music descended to tranquil music and a man backstage ran to the runway designer sign and put another designer&rsquo;s name on top of Ellassay&rsquo;s. Apparently another show was about to begin.</p>

<p>This quick transition led to Deng Hao opening a new show. Garments bursting with bright colors, mixed and matched patterns and the most amazing details with florals and paisley. Sheer tops and dramatic cuts floated this way and that. Guests literally &ldquo;oohed&rdquo; and &ldquo;ahhed&rdquo; after each design went by, even leaning in closer to look at each intricate detail. As explained by the designers, flowers are the soul element of the Denghao brand. The brand focuses on high color saturation and floral patterns like those portrayed in oil paintings. &ldquo;Let women look as good-looking as flowers&rdquo; is not only the designer&rsquo;s greatest wish, but is also the company&rsquo;s greatest goal. Bravo, Fashion Shenzhen&mdash;what a fun, surprising show!</p>
