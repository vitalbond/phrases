<p><a href="https://iheartmd.com/home" target="_blank">iHeartMD</a>, a new healthstyle (health + lifestyle) subscription box, curates the latest and best heart healthy ingredients, products, and information on the market!</p>
<p>Every month, iHeartMD sends subscribers a box full of heart healthy products (food, drinks, wellness, fitness) that fall in one of three categories: nutrition, exercise, and stress management. The idea is to promote overall heart health and offer a basic food education to Americans, allowing them to declutter the health food market and to make more informed decisions regarding their heart health.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_09181.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-72804];player=img;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="iHeartMD" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_09181-1024x819.jpg" width="553" height="442"></a></p>
<p>iHeartMD&rsquo;s recommendations are loosely based on the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle (largely inspired by&nbsp;the travels of co-founder &amp; chief lifestyle consultant, Nyssa). iHeartMD has a panel of 10 cardiologists throughout the country that have approved all the recommendations before they are sent out. In addition to the box, subscribers have access to exclusive digital content that includes recipes, nutrition advice, tips, infographics, and a monthly Q&amp;A session with co-founder, chief health consultant, &amp; cardiologist, Vinod. Subscribers are able to send in their questions, and iHeartMD&nbsp;picks 5 of the best and most popular ones for Vinod to answer. For every box sold, $1 is donated to non-profits that work to end obesity and hunger issues in the U.S. And because eating and living healthy starts early,&nbsp;iHeartMD is soon launching an iHeartMD Kids Box!</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of trying&nbsp;out&nbsp;iHeartMD&rsquo;s&nbsp;first box&nbsp;- The&nbsp;Founder&rsquo;s Edition!&nbsp;I love the positive message that iHeartMD&nbsp;sends to subscribers.&nbsp;They not only provide very healthy snacks, but also highlight the critical role that fitness plays in our healthstyle.&nbsp;In my box were the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0926b.png" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-72804];player=img;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="iHeartMD" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0926b-1024x846.png" width="553" height="457"></a></p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.teechia.com/">TeeChia Super Seeds Cereal (Cranberry Apple)</a> &ndash; I enjoyed the fruity taste additions to this low-cholesterol breakfast! This cereal also acts as a great snack alternative to traditional oatmeal and can easily be prepared under a minute.</p>
<p>2) <a href="http://www.marysgonecrackers.com/">Mary&rsquo;s Gone Crackers</a> &ndash; Looking for a healthy, baked, and organic snack alternative to traditional crackers? These crackers will keep you guilt-free as you continue to reach for more. There are no added oils or fats, and the snack is both gluten-free and wheat-free! Browse the website to learn about Mary&rsquo;s amazing story!</p>
<p>3) <a href="http://chefrobertsdirect.com/">Matt&rsquo;s Munchies Premium Fruit Snack, Apple-licious</a> &ndash; This snack brought me back to my childhood, when my friends and I used to eat fruit roll-ups&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">all the time&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">during our snack or lunch breaks! I felt so nostalgic eating Matt&rsquo;s Munchies Premium Fruit Snack, yet it tasted even better and healthier with its apple-licious flavor! (Although it&rsquo;s always best to consume the actual apple itself, this is a creative &amp; fun snack alternative.)</span></p>
<p>4)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pearlsolives.com/olivestogo/index.html">Pearls Olives To Go!</a> by <a href="http://www.olives.com/">Musco Family Olive Co.</a> &ndash; While I didn&rsquo;t have these olives to go, I absolutely loved these olives as a perfect snack size for my eating at home. Being an olives lover, I simply added the olives onto a salad and was easily satisfied (I love any olives on my salads!!).</p>
<p>5) <a href="http://www.itrain.com/">$50 iTrain Vouchers</a> &ndash; When I first browsed iTrain.com, I was very impressed with the many options to choose from given the $50 credit I received. So far, I have tried one full-length cross-training fitness video (&ldquo;Seasons Are Changing And You Can Too&rdquo;) that worked my entire body. I loved being able to do this exercise at home, having my appropriate workout tools readily available: weights, an exercise ball, and a yoga mat! I definitely had a stronger workout than I thought I would have! &mdash; &ldquo;Shed extra pounds from the winter season and tighten and tone your whole body.&rdquo; For just $9.99, this video can be bought among many other choices of equal price.</p>
<p>6) <a href="http://www.ghirardelli.com/">Ghirardelli Intense Dark 72% Cacao Twilight Delight Squares</a> &ndash; To reap the heart-healthy benefits, opt for chocolate with 70% cocoa content &ndash; a healthier alternative to the traditional milk chocolate. Feeling creative, I melted the chocolate and enjoyed it with strawberries I bought from the grocery store. They were divine!</p>
<p>7) <a href="http://www.nakedwines.com/">$50 Naked Wines Voucher</a> &ndash; iHeartMD recommends Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Syrah, &amp; Pinot Noir! While I didn&rsquo;t get the chance to order any wine, since the website requires a minimum purchase of 6 bottles, I feel this gift card would be perfect for anyone hosting a big celebration! The Naked Wines website provides many options to choose from.</p>
