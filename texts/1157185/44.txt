<div><p>Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; today&rsquo;s world is busy. With so much hustle and bustle, it&rsquo;s tough getting the simplest of tasks done, let alone picking out an <a href="http://www.chicgalleria.com/2011/11/history-diamond-engagement-ring/">engagement ring</a>. That&rsquo;s why many have turned to buying engagement rings online. Buying online takes a lot of the hassle out of shopping for that once in a lifetime purchase, and here are 4 reasons why.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-73196" alt="Engagement Ring" src="http://www.chicgalleria.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dreamstime_2062551_0662.jpg" width="580" height="386"></p>
<p><b>Time</b></p>
<p>These days, you&rsquo;re lucky if you can carve out a 5-minute coffee break, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that shopping for your impending nuptials can fall by the wayside. Saying &ldquo;I do&rdquo; to the one you love is not a quick decision that is easily made, neither is finding the ring that takes your breath away.&nbsp;Fortunately for us, online shops have given shoppers the ability to shop for their engagement ring needs at their own comfort and leisure. If you&rsquo;re working a 9-5, you have to make additional effort to find a ring in your already busy schedule. Buying online gives you the option of being able to look for what you want, when you want.</p>
<p><b>Convenience</b></p>
<p>One of my biggest aversions to shopping in stores is a pushy sales associate. You walk into a store, the little buzzer sounds off indicating your presence, and before you can take another breath, a sales person is under your nose ready to solicit your business. Though having a person there to answer your questions can be helpful, having them watch you like a hawk in hopes of getting a sale can put a damper on your experience. Going online alleviates&nbsp;the pressures a sales person can bring, and more often than not, you can contact a representative online should you have any questions.</p>
<p><b>Options</b></p>
<p>When you go to a jeweler, what you see is what you get, and chances are you won&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re looking for. So if you are looking for the perfect vintage wedding ring, you can visit online stores, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.leohamel.com/shop/brands.cfm?itid=9&amp;all=yes&amp;engagement=y&amp;vintage=yes&amp;pg=Vintage%20Engagement%20Rings">LeoHamel.com</a>,&nbsp;that carry the specific style of ring you want. This store carries a variety of adorable vintage rings and has clear-cut policies on promise of quality and satisfaction, which brings me to my next reason.</p>
<p><b>Guarantee of Quality</b></p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for apprehension of buying an engagement ring online is the fear of being ripped off. Now, while that is a legitimate fear to have, reputable online jewelers are very aware and thoughtful of their reputations. It&rsquo;s very easy to search an online jeweler&rsquo;s background online, and one bad review is the <a href="http://searchengineland.com/2013-study-79-of-consumers-trust-online-reviews-as-much-as-personal-recommendations-164565">difference between getting business and losing it</a>. So more often than not, there are more perks with going the online route.&nbsp; Be sure to check the policies of the retailer when looking to make a purchase. Not only do online jewelers go out of their way to make sure you&rsquo;re satisfied with your purchase, they will additionally offer added services that a traditional jeweler may not; so make it a point to check their FAQ&rsquo;s to see what resources are available to you.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s overeager sales associates, not enough time in the day, or not having a big enough selection, the reality of buying a ring can be difficult for the modern couple. Fortunately, with online shopping, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about the pushy sales person or having to take time off to find the perfect ring. With these distractions out of the way, it gives you the ability to enjoy picking out the perfect ring that you plan on wearing for a lifetime.</p>
