<p>As a firm believer in yoga, I take notice when a new and noteworthy DVD comes out from Gaiam and its wonderfully&nbsp;trained and regular yoga practitioners. Colleen Saidman has been practicing yoga since 1987 and teaching yoga for over 15 years; her newest DVD is <strong>Calorie Killer Yoga</strong>. This highly energetic DVD contains five different sequences: constant cardio, energy &amp; endurance, sustained burn, rise &amp; shine, and balance &amp; restore. Each installment helps to transform your body and support a healthy weight. Colleen believes &ldquo;that yoga is a great tool for sustainable weight loss because it&rsquo;s more than just an hour a day on the mat: it&rsquo;s a lifestyle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With continual practice and creation, Colleen has &ldquo;been refining sequences so that one can get a great workout without compromising one&rsquo;s joints&rdquo; &mdash; thereby optimizing healthy weight while being kind to your body. Colleen also &ldquo;incorporates abdominals in every section, targeting the areas that a lot of women would like to tone&ndash;thighs, arms, butt, and belly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While personally practicing the five different yoga sequences energized my body, my mind and focus also felt strengthened. In addition, as Colleen recognizes &ldquo;yoga is about so much more than weight loss. It&rsquo;s really about falling in love with yourself and coming from a place of acceptance and gratitude.&rdquo; This DVD provides a positive and spirited practice. &ldquo;On the one hand, I&rsquo;m asking women to accept their bodies and stop being so hard on themselves,&rdquo; Colleen explains; Yet, &ldquo;there are a lot of people that will benefit greatly &ndash; physically, mentally and emotionally &ndash; from losing weight.&rdquo; These are the main and respectable reasons for creating this DVD.</p>
<p>Colleen pointed out, and I agree, that &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to be an experienced yogi to practice this DVD. But, you will get a good, well balanced workout.&rdquo; The DVD also includes an eight-minute breath-awareness and body-scan meditation.
