<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love watching your grandma cook? Or better yet, eating your granny&rsquo;s delicious homemade food? Grannies have that special touch for homemade, traditional dishes that we try our best to emulate. How can we remember and preserve the ways our grannies cook? Caroline Shin, multimedia journalist and creator of the new <a href="http://kck.st/1f0hNBS">&ldquo;Cooking with Granny&rdquo;</a> web series, hopes to reinvigorate the love we have for not only our grandma&rsquo;s cooking, but her culture and history as well. Shin&rsquo;s mission is to create an all-encompassing web series about food, immigration, and multiculturalism through her filmed interactions with grandmas in their kitchens and local New York grocery stores.</p>
<p><b>Grannies to Learn From:<br></b>Inspired by Shin&rsquo;s own granny, Sanok Kim, &ldquo;Cooking with Granny&rdquo; aims to give thanks to the grannies that have made our lives easier &ndash; well, to say the least! When asked about how important it is to preserve homemade recipes as well as the history of our wonderful grandmothers, Shin states, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so important! Our grannies have spoiled us, fed us, and taken us shopping. And depending on the different immigration flows, our grandmothers have paved the way for us to be an American, or to be a New Yorker, or in my case, taken care of me and my siblings while both my parents worked full-time jobs. How could we allow ourselves to forget those people who have figured so lovingly in our lives? But put it simply, don&rsquo;t you love your granny&rsquo;s cooking? Don&rsquo;t you miss it? Well, with these recipes at your hand, you now have that control to make those dishes you grew up with. And you know they&rsquo;ll be redolent with that nostalgia and well, simple deliciousness!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Foods to Look Forward To:</b><br>
Get ready for some Caribbean, Greek, Korean, Puerto Rican, Russian-Jewish, and more foods in the works, as this part cooking show, part docu-series kicks off! Shin speaks with enthusiasm for her upcoming projects: &ldquo;Right now, I&rsquo;m super excited about this Greek grandma who&rsquo;ll be reviving an &lsquo;old-country,&rsquo; old-time red-win braised octopus stew. And man, she&rsquo;s got a story to tell. It&rsquo;s about the first time she went shopping for whole octopus in Astoria back in the day. She was lost! And I have this one Caribbean grandma who makes the tastiest hot sauce &mdash; the ingredients are so fresh &mdash; she&rsquo;s all about farm-fresh, organic, just like in her home country of Trinidad and Tobago. So yeah, her hot sauce &mdash; it&rsquo;s not just spicy, it&rsquo;s fruity and flavorful.&rdquo; As for her own granny&rsquo;s cooking, Shin has already shot a delicious Korean-style bacon episode with her granny and will publish it after her Kickstarter campaign ends! In the meantime, take a look at her very first episode below, where she and her granny make kimchi from scratch!</p>

<p><b>Artistry and Creativity to Watch Out For:<br></b>Endless work goes into the artistry and creativity of Shin&rsquo;s web series. Organization and determination allow her to focus on three key items for each production: &ldquo;The story line, the composition and the characters. The story line should have a beginning, middle and end and keep the viewer hooked. The composition, well, I appreciate the art form of a camera production, whether it&rsquo;s photo or video. Whether it&rsquo;s balance or strange angles, I need the footage to look good. That&rsquo;s very important to me. I still see it as visual art. And well, characters, that depends on the story &mdash; a dry news conference versus an entertaining feature. &lsquo;Cooking with Granny&rsquo; falls into the latter category, so it&rsquo;s about smiles, laughs, quirks, tears. A connection with the viewers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Donations for the &ldquo;Cooking with Granny&rdquo; Kickstarter:</b></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cooking with Granny&rdquo; Kickstarter campaign launched last month, as of April 22, 2014. If the project does not reach its $11,000 funding goal by Wednesday, May 21, 2014, it will not receive any monetary support, per Kickstarter&rsquo;s all-or-nothing model, and the show cannot be produced. Funds would cover crew, equipment and ingredient costs, so please pledge to the &ldquo;Cooking with Granny&rdquo; Kickstarter ASAP &ndash; not just for personal support but for thanks to all our grannies out there! <b>Please visit</b><b>&nbsp;<a href="http://kck.st/1f0hNBS">KICKSTARTER</a> </b><b></b><b>to donate!</b></p>
