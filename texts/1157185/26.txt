<p>One of the most sought-after music festivals of the year,&nbsp;Coachella&nbsp;is right around the corner and more than 75,000 people, per day, will flock to the fields of Indio and brave the elements for two weekends of amazing music. But, what about the music lovers who wish to skip the long bathroom lines, the less-than-glamorous outdoor camping accommodations, the nightmare of parking and, let&rsquo;s not forget&hellip; traffic!&nbsp; However, what if you want to live large and do&nbsp;Coachella&nbsp;the &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; way!?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s definitely possible to go glam to this music festival, and Rachel McIntyre, CEO of luxury accommodations service, Black Door Experiences, can provide all the tips and tricks for your posh readers looking to navigate this year&rsquo;s&nbsp;Coachella&nbsp;Music Festival in style!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Coachella Fashion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sunglasses:</strong>&nbsp;The sun gets as hot and bright as can be, so sunnies are essential. Wild Soul Sunglasses are my go to. Combing fashion and philanthropy, <a href="http://www.thewildsoul.com/">Wild Soul</a> glasses look&nbsp;amazing and proceeds go to a good cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fashionable, charitable, and retro-inspired hot sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>The ultimate bag:</strong>&nbsp;You will be carrying your essentials day in and day out, so it needs to be comfortable &ndash; I recommend a backpack. &nbsp;A cross body or shoulder bag will make for a&nbsp;painful shoulder. &nbsp;Some of my favorites (and best price): <a href="http://www.herschelsupply.com/">Herschel Supply</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asos.com/">Asos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coach.com/">Coach </a>(if you dare)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;The ultimate footwear:</strong> I can&rsquo;t stretch how important it is to be comfortable! No less than two pairs should be packed in your bag when you head to your weekend of fun in the&nbsp;sun. My go to are:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sperrytopsider.com/">Sperry</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uggaustralia.com/">Ugg</a>, <a href="http://www.toms.com/">Toms</a> (for those who really want to live the Cochella way)</p>
<p><strong>The ultimate hat:</strong> My favorite part of the Cochella &ldquo;outfit&rdquo; is the hat. A straw fedora would be my number one pick. It&rsquo;s light, easy to pack, and can be worn at night.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nordstroms.com/">Nordstrom</a> has their own line with great choices (and free shipping!). If you want to go with more of a baseball hat look and still have swag, <a href="http://www.gentsco.com/">Gents</a> is my go to. &nbsp;You can customize your own or grab one of their signature styles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Coachella Beauty</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much is needed as far as beauty at Cochella, as we all embrace our &lsquo;natural&rsquo; beauty, but there are some essentials to add to your backpack.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Number one is water!</strong></p>
<p>A necessity for you is&nbsp;to stay&nbsp;hydrated and keep your skin glowing and moist. I suggest a refillable water bottle, given that&nbsp;they have water stations to refill throughout the festival.&nbsp;Fast, easy, and the best way to be environmentally-savvy while saving some $$.</p>
<p>If you want more of a glossy look and to stay moisturized, my new favorite lip balm is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nudeskincare.com/products/face/moisturisers/nude_lips/" target="_blank">Nude Lips by Nude Skincare</a>. This silky organic balm contains cupuacu and Tahitian vanilla&nbsp;monoi that melts into your lips when you rub them together. Shea butter, vitamin E and coconut oil keep your lip healthy and smooth.</p>
<p>If you are looking to add a little pop to go with your lip balm and naturally rosy cheeks (from the sun), add three coats of Carmindy &amp; Co. Elevate Mascara in&nbsp;Midnight&nbsp;Black. This will give&nbsp;you that Cochella glam look should you want to look extra special.</p>
<p><strong>Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Bull Frog Gel is sweat-resistant, scentless and colorless, and&nbsp;engineered to stay put in and out of water. This is Sunscreen&rsquo;s best kept Secret.</p>
<p>*Don&rsquo;t forget your hands!&nbsp;To refresh and stay germ free, carry a travel size of Burt&rsquo;s Bees facial cleansing towelettes with white tea extract.</p>
<p>Lastly, MAC&rsquo;s Mineralized Charged Water Skin Hydrating Mist is the same as hydrating tonic spray, but the gold sparkles add a little Cochella glam&nbsp;while still enhancing your natural&nbsp;beauty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Accommodations</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sooo not into camping, but still want to stay true to the vibe of Coachella, you can do AirBnB or couch surf if you please. It&rsquo;s a come all be all festival, and most people&nbsp;are open to sharing. But if you don&rsquo;t mind spending a little more and being a bit further way, Ace Hotel, Parker, Korakia are great options as well. &nbsp;Another option which not many&nbsp;people know about, again if you want a unique experience and are willing to spend more money, &nbsp;is the on-site Safari Tents, which are in an exclusive area with your own off-site&nbsp;private check-in. They are fully furnished, shaker-style tents that are air conditioned and have upscale showers, restrooms, and golf cart shuttles to get you to and from the&nbsp;shows.</p>
