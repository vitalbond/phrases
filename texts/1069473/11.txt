I can feel the baby making it's presence felt, it's kicking A LOT now. Oh, and you might have noticed from my MMM'13 documentation pics that I'm getting BIG. My beloved <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/mariner-t-shirt.html" target="_blank">Mariner T-shirt</a> is starting to get on the tight side, and I don't think it'll be long before wearing it would be asking too much of the properties of jersey! Then what will I wear to pregnancy yoga?! Time to get stitching....</div><div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XewmSBu-fNQ/UZTKAp5dh8I/AAAAAAAAI_s/bNlA4JIc2pc/s1600/DSC00080-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="285" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XewmSBu-fNQ/UZTKAp5dh8I/AAAAAAAAI_s/bNlA4JIc2pc/s400/DSC00080-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><div><br></div><div>And the result was this awesome stripey number! Using up another piece of stripey jersey from my stash, I used basically the same pattern as the one I developed for the Mariner T-shirt, but increased the width around the whole torso, but particularly round the belly area. This navy and white striped jersey has so much elastane content that, combined with the added girth, I wouldn't be surprised if this top sees me through the third trimester as well. </div><div><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AZPHpYE75FE/UZTKRfrp4KI/AAAAAAAAI_0/BCJURypRgVE/s1600/MMM13Day11.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AZPHpYE75FE/UZTKRfrp4KI/AAAAAAAAI_0/BCJURypRgVE/s400/MMM13Day11.jpg" width="297"></a></div><div><br></div><div>I cut the strip for the neck binding so I would have a solid navy part running framing the neck hole. I love this jersey and this style of top and I'm pretty sure that whatever size/shape I end up as after I have the baby, that I'll be able to rework it at the side seams so it will have a life beyond the next four and a half months. </div></div>
