A quick recap about the Perfect Pattern Parcels: the organisers put together a package of PDF sewing patterns along a theme which have been created by indie designers. You can then purchase the pattern parcel for a price of your choice for a limited time only, and then ALL the profits go to supporting a charity called Donors Choose which funds and supports educational projects in the US. The first one I helped to promote was <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/perfect-pattern-parcel-2-girls-wear-for.html" target="_blank">#2, the little girl's pattern parcel</a>. Parcel #3 is a Spring/Summer womenswear set of delights and will be <a href="http://goo.gl/mHCSxB" target="_blank">on sale here</a> between 30th May and 13th June.<br><br>Pattern Parcel #3 includes:<br><a href="http://www.makeitperfect.com.au/MIP/Poppy_Tunic.html" target="_blank">Poppy Tunic</a> by Make it Perfect<br><a href="http://radianthomestudio.com/downloads/water-bottle-tote-pdf-pattern/" target="_blank">Water Bottle Tote</a> by Radiant Home Studio<br><a href="http://jennabrand.com/2013/05/27/jorna-a-tankjumperdress-pattern/" target="_blank">Jorna Tank Dress</a> by Jenna Brand<br><a href="http://april-rhodes.com/collections/patternshop/products/the-staple-dress-pdf" target="_blank">Staple Dress</a> by April Rhodes<br><a href="http://closetcasefiles.com/the-bombshell-swimsuit-is-here/" target="_blank">Bombshell Swimsuit</a> by Closet Case Files <br><br>Bonus Pattern: Choose a price of $28 or greater for Parcel #3 and you will automatically also be sent the Bonus Pattern!

I've had my eye on that pattern for yonks and yonks (I'd make it in leopard print, and it would be amazing, FYI). But I had to be honest with myself about A) the time I have for sewing projects these days, and B) the lack of cash to splash on the fabric and notions required for a swimming costume project. Plus, I always prefer to make something from fabric I already own than to buy new fabric. So instead of the Bombshell, I chose a quicker make that I could stash-bust the hell out of. <a href="http://april-rhodes.com/collections/patternshop/products/the-staple-dress-pdf" target="_blank">The Staple Dress by April Rhodes</a> fit the bill.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5D72Psd3hFg/U4I8wNbZR6I/AAAAAAAAKDQ/gYjdJUXT-CY/s1600/DSC00528-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5D72Psd3hFg/U4I8wNbZR6I/AAAAAAAAKDQ/gYjdJUXT-CY/s1600/DSC00528-1.jpg" height="400" width="300"></a></div><br><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The Staple dress is a lot like the <a href="http://www.burdastyle.com/pattern_store/patterns/anda" target="_blank">Anda dress by Burdastyle</a> (remember that?!) but a bit more finessed. A casual semi-fitted style with a gathered waist. It's a great canvas for a great print, however I couldn't find any printed fabric in my stash that was sufficient in quantity for this pattern. I've had this length of navy crepe since I worked in a shonky clothing company in London about seven years ago. It was a sample length that was literally put in the bin (I took it out when no-one was looking). It would be great for a flowy pair of trousers, like my Nautical palazzo pants perhaps, but it wasn't long enough. So although the Staple dress's instructions didn't include crepe in the recommended fabrics list, I thought I'd use it for the project anyway and it's worked really well. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BM8KHWv8Hys/U4I9OdYnAGI/AAAAAAAAKDg/W-Djh7muDBI/s1600/DSC00532-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BM8KHWv8Hys/U4I9OdYnAGI/AAAAAAAAKDg/W-Djh7muDBI/s1600/DSC00532-1.jpg" height="300" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When I made the <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/perfect-pattern-parcel-2-girls-wear-for.html" target="_blank">September Tunic/Dress pattern to help promote the #2 Perfect Pattern Parcel</a>, I kept the make pretty simple and true to the basic pattern so people could see clearly what that pattern looked like. This time I thought a plain navy dress, although potentially classic and timeless, might be a bit boring so why not pimp the pattern with my own twist to show people how they could use the pattern as a template for something different? I hit my '<a href="http://gb.pinterest.com/zozowahine/modern-garments-sewing-inspiration/" target="_blank">Modern Garments Sewing Inspiration</a>' Pinterest board for some ideas. At first I though about some kind of ruffle detail, but I thought that might get lost in the dark colour so I opted for a contrast bib/tuxedo detail instead. The bib section itself is made from part of an old bedsheet and the navy plastic buttons also came from my stash so I had to buy <i>nada</i> for this project.

In fact you can chose you own price depending on how flush you are feeling! What I also like is that, not only do you then own patterns that you know you really like, but also some patterns that might be growers and you may choose to make in the future (which is how I'm feeling about the Poppy Tunic in this #3 parcel actually...). The last parcel sale raised $1800 for the DonorsChoose.org charity, why not head over to the <a href="http://goo.gl/mHCSxB" target="_blank">Perfect Pattern Parcel site</a> and bag yourself some great patterns and help them raise even more?</div><br><center><a href="https://patternparcel.com/"><img alt="Buy Pattern Parcel #3" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RKpQZf8QBEY/U4TWf6eyhsI/AAAAAAAAyic/BvB8OU__osk/w384-h169-no/buy+button+curves.jpg" target="_blank" width="250"></a></center><center></center><center style="text-align: left;">If you still need some convincing, here are the links to a whole heap of AMAZING sewers who will be blogging about their versions of the various patterns for the duration of the sale:</center><br>Friday, May 30  <a href="http://sewbusylizzy.com/">Sew Busy Lizzy</a> ||  <a href="http://pienkel.blogspot.com/">Pienkel</a> ||  <a href="http://seamstresserin.com/">SeamstressErin</a><br><br>Saturday, May 31 <a href="http://blog.lindsaywoodward.com/">Design By Lindsay</a> ||  <a href="http://www.thebrodrickdesignstudio.co.uk/">the Brodrick design studio</a> ||  <a href="http://cookinandcraftin.blogspot.com/">Cookin' and Craftin'</a><br><br>Sunday, June 1 <a href="http://chainstitcher.blogspot.co.uk/">Diary of a Chainstitcher</a> ||  <a href="http://ahappystitch.com/">a happy stitch</a> ||  <a href="http://disaster-inadress.blogspot.com/">Disaster in a Dress</a> ||  <a href="http://sewamysew.com/">sew Amy sew</a><br><br>Monday, June 2  <a href="http://www.idlefancy.com/">Idle Fancy</a> ||  <a href="http://casaturtle.com/">Casa Crafty</a> ||  <a href="http://katiekadiddlehopper.blogspot.com/">Kadiddlehopper</a> ||  <a href="http://www.dandeliondrift.com/">Dandelion Drift</a><br><br>Tuesday, June 3  <a href="http://chrisanderinkeith.blogspot.com/">Our Family Four</a> ||  <a href="http://casaturtle.com/">Casa Crafty</a> ||  <a href="http://cookinandcraftin.blogspot.com/">Cookin' and Craftin'</a> ||  <a href="http://ahappystitch.com/">a happy stitch</a><br><br>Wednesday, June 4  <a href="http://www.leximade.com/">Lexi Made</a> ||  <a href="http://thequirkypeach.blogspot.com/">The Quirky Peach</a> ||  <a href="http://mattandhollicoats.blogspot.com/">Stitched</a> ||  <a href="http://ahappystitch.com/">a happy stitch</a> ||  <a href="http://casaturtle.com/">Casa Crafty</a> ||  <br><br>Thursday, June 5  <a href="http://verypurpleperson.com/">verypurpleperson</a> ||  <a href="http://casaturtle.com/">Casa Crafty</a> ||  <a href="http://sewastraigthtline.com/">sew a straight line</a> ||  <a href="http://sewbon.com/">Sewbon</a><br><br>Friday, June 6 <a href="http://www.shawntasews.com/">Shawnta Sews</a> ||  <a href="http://mama-says-sew.blogspot.com/">Mama says sew</a> ||  <a href="http://ahappystitch.com/">a happy stitch</a> ||  <a href="http://cookinandcraftin.blogspot.com/">Cookin' and Craftin'</a><br><br>Saturday, June 7 <a href="http://casaturtle.com/">Casa Crafty</a> ||  <a href="http://sewninestitches.blogspot.com.au/">sewninestitches</a> ||  <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/">'So, Zo...
