<div>After the lovely response <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/my-first-podcast-audio-post.html" target="_blank">my first podcast/audio post</a> received last month, we decided to make another (with added seagulls and aeroplanes for authenticity!). This time Pat and my discussion expands on the theme of self-employment, including an update of 'the story so far' plus thoughts of the future...<br><br>Once again, your thought on this/these audio posts are most welcome, including anything you'd like to hear me chat on about in the near future!<br><br>Oh WAIT!!! An added extra in this audio post is that I let slip the gender of our baby-to-be! Please no spoilers in the comments peops!<br><br><br><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F97397318" width="100%"></iframe></div>
