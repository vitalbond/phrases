It's 1st May and therefore the start of the month-long challenge, Me-Made-May'14! Let's celebrate with a giveaway. In fact every week throughout May there will be a MMMay'14 related giveaway taking place either here or over at <a href="http://www.jenniferlaurenvintage.com/" target="_blank">Jennifer Lauren Vintage</a>'s blog. But let's start with this one...<br><br><a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/happy-mmmay13-participants-giveaway.html" target="_blank">Just like last year</a>, my lovely blog sponsor Susan at <a href="http://sewbox.co.uk/">Sewbox.co.uk</a>&nbsp;is offering up two awesome prizes to be won by two lucky challenge participants. And what is special about this giveaway is that YOU get to choose what YOU would like to win! Genius! Here are the two options...<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2DaoZOioF7M/U1E099PHezI/AAAAAAAAJ3I/cwM4ULon1sM/s1600/mae_package_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2DaoZOioF7M/U1E099PHezI/AAAAAAAAJ3I/cwM4ULon1sM/s1600/mae_package_1.jpg" height="277" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><b>Prize Option 1</b>: YOUR CHOICE of sewing pattern from <a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/sewing-patterns.html" target="_blank">their enormous selection</a>. Sewbox.co.uk have a really wide range of independent sewing pattern companies' products including Colette Patterns, Sewaholic, DIY Couture, By Hand London, Cake patterns, Christina Haynes patterns and MANY MORE. Personally, I'd be tempted by&nbsp;t<a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/sewing-patterns/mae-blouse.html" target="_blank">he Mae blouse by Bluegingerdoll</a> (pictured above) or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/sewing-patterns/serendipity-studio-the-sally-dress.html" target="_blank">the Sally Dress by Serendipity Studio</a>&nbsp;(pictured below).<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7F5g8zMdhUQ/U1E0aYfLmhI/AAAAAAAAJ3A/jzfD0ay2EAk/s1600/shirtdress.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7F5g8zMdhUQ/U1E0aYfLmhI/AAAAAAAAJ3A/jzfD0ay2EAk/s1600/shirtdress.jpg" height="400" width="255"></a></div><br><b>Prize Option 2</b>: YOUR CHOICE of 1 metre of fabric from <a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/fabrics.html" target="_blank">their drool-inducing selection</a>. They have more <a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/fabrics/liberty-fabrics.html" target="_blank">Liberty prints</a> than you can shake a stick at, so if you are a Liberty-lover, then now's your chance to snaffle a metre of something delicious! (Remember, if you win you can buy extra of your chosen fabric from Sewbox so you have enough to make a more fabric-hungry garment.) Not that anyone's asked me, but I'd go for the <a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/fabrics/john-kaldor-3119-aqua.html" target="_blank">John Kaldor Cassandra crepe de chine in Aqua</a>&nbsp;(pictured below). <br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KOu2My6jKj4/U1E2WmMZWJI/AAAAAAAAJ3U/zZo6CyVM6bY/s1600/cassandra_3119_aqua_2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KOu2My6jKj4/U1E2WmMZWJI/AAAAAAAAJ3U/zZo6CyVM6bY/s1600/cassandra_3119_aqua_2.jpg"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>How to Enter:</b> Apologies to readers of this blog who are not participating this year in Me-Made-May challenge, this giveaway competition is only for MMMay'14 participants.</div><br>So, if you are a participant of MMMay'14 and fancy a new sewing pattern or 1 metre of beautiful fabric to indulge your love of making stuff, then visit the <a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sewbox.co.uk site</a> and decide which item you'd like to be in the running for.&nbsp;Then leave a comment on this blog post saying if you would like to win prize option 1 or 2, PLUS a link to the item you'd like to receive PLUS a way for me to contact you if you are successful (i.e. if I can't find your email address within two clicks of my mouse, leave your email address in the body of the comment).

Please choose one prize option only and please only enter the giveaway once. Multiple entries will be discounted, as will any entries that do not tell me which item you'd like to win (honestly, you'd be surprised by how many people will no longer be reading this far down the post...). And just to clarify, if you win your choice of item, there will be no cost to yourself, it will be posted to you for free.<br><br>The following day (Friday 9th May) I will use a random number generator to select one winner for a sewing pattern and one winner for 1 metre of fabric and contact them to get their postal addresses to forward on to Sewbox.co.uk so they can send out the prizes.
