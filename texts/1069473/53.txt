Now that I am really down the 'business end' of this pregnancy (eight months / 36 weeks in) I thought another update might be of interest to those same readers.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So you see my clothing rail pictured above? See the little chunk of clothes gathered at the far left? That is now what I can fit in. The similarly small chunk of clothes slightly to the right of that is the (all secondhand) knitwear that I can wear with my maternity garments. From the end of my first trimester, as my body started to change, I started to implement a useful piece of advice I'd read about removing the items from your wardrobe that&nbsp;gradually began to feel too tight so that dressing in the mornings doesn't get really difficult (not to mention a bit disheartening). I did that for a long time, but as you can now see, if I still did that my rail would be virtually empty and all my clothing would be stuffed in bags wedged into corners round the rest of our flat!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Therefore whilst unpacking from our recent move, I decided to rehang any garments I theoretically think I might fit into again during the first few months after the birth, particularly items that I think I may be able to wear whilst breast feeding. That's what the larger chunk of garments on the right of the rail in the photo comprises of. Doing that has also had the beneficial effect of reminding me that colour and variety in dressing will soon be an option once again. I still have one MASSIVE storage bag full of lovely garments that I doubt will either fit for some time (if ever!) or be breast-feeding friendly, but that's fine: the selection to the right of that rail above is a veritable wardrobe feast in comparison with my clothing options right now. Plus, I've discovered during this pregnancy that working with a smaller than my previous selection creates far fewer headaches, especially if the colours of your items mix and match well. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So back to what my eight month maternity consists of:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Tops:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t3LylE-9SyE/UiWLI80rpYI/AAAAAAAAJd0/AKb6Gtk_nUE/s1600/DSC00302-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="257" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t3LylE-9SyE/UiWLI80rpYI/AAAAAAAAJd0/AKb6Gtk_nUE/s400/DSC00302-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><ul><li><a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/refashion-friday-spotty-jersey-dress-to.html" target="_blank">Spotty dress-to-maternity T-shirt</a> with gathered sides.

This has been soooo useful. It can be worn on its own or as a tunic with bottoms. One day, when I'm done with breast feeding, I'll take it in a bit at the sides (assuming I'll need to!) so that I can get lots of non-maternity use from it.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/maternity-sewing-successes-and-failures.html" target="_blank">Black batwing jersey dress</a>. This has been the garment that made me feel the nicest and least frumpy!

To be honest I haven't worn this since getting back from our holiday. A few commenters suggested that belting it would make it look less frumpy, and whilst I agree that the belted dress look often looks great on some pregnant women, I personally can't stand the feeling of a belt around my rib cage. &nbsp;</li><li>Secondhand Topshop maternity tea dress (not shown because it's somewhere in the laundry process). As I previously stated, I wasn't planning on buying any maternity wear beyond bras, but when I saw a lovely light-weight maternity tea dress in a charity shop just before our holiday I decided to buy it. It's got a low-cut cross-over bust part that I think will also make it useful for breast feeding.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Other garments:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><ul><li>My '<b>loungewear'</b> still consists of two ropey pairs of secondhand jogging bottoms and some large baggy dude-T-shirts.</li><li>My <b>sleepwear</b> still consists of my biggest pyjama bottoms and more baggy dude-T-shirts.</li><li>I'm working with a limited selection of my largest <b>undies</b>, but I think I can get away with continuing to do so if I keep on top of the laundry (making some more in a bigger size would be pretty disheartening at this point).&nbsp;</li><li>My usual selection of secondhand <b>cardigans</b> are seeing me through very well thanks to the seasonal weather. If I was heavily pregnant in deep Winter I might require some cardigans or warm layers that wrap over/cover the bump instead.&nbsp;</li><li>One unpredicted maternity purchase that I did end up making was a secondhand <b>maternity 'tankini'</b> bought on eBay to wear on our recent holiday to Spain. I only wore it twice, but it's now been packed in my hospital bag as I'm hoping that water will be involved in my birth at some point and I may feel the need for a bit of coverage at least towards the beginning of labour.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div></div>
