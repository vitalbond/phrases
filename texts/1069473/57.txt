However, it's one of those ideas that is so genius that even those that are not likely to deploy it in the immediate future might hang on to it for use in the future, or to pass on to someone else for whom it may become relevant.<br><br>This is not my idea. It is <a href="http://keepupwithusjones.blogspot.ca/2012/06/get-used-to-me-saying-bra-lot-in-this.html" target="_blank">an idea</a> I found on Pinterest that has been devised (or at least explained) by <a href="http://keepupwithusjones.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">Valeri on her blog 'Keeping Up With Us Jones''</a>. As soon as I saw it I clocked it as a genius way to avoid buying any more new stuff and spending any more money than is necessary on this whole <i>'being pregnant and having a baby'</i> scenario.<br><br>Some time ago I received a comment from <a href="http://mommymadebyjen.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">the lovely Jen</a> on my <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/maternity-wardrobe-eight-months-plus.html" target="_blank">Eight Month Maternity Wardrobe post</a> that included the following tip:<br><br><b><i>"Just make sure you invest in some good nursing bras - they can really be the best thing for making you feel better about your body afterwards, when you feel as though your pre-pregnancy figure is gone forever, especially since now there are some lovely options out there for nursing bras."</i></b><br><br>I totally took that suggestion to heart. I thought that, seeing as I've saved quite a bit of money maternity clothing by making, repurposing and borrowing all I've needed, I would treat myself to one or two nice nursing bras. So I went into a couple of fancy maternity shops but two things became apparent: A) my boobs are currently too big for all the nice nursing bras I saw on my attempted shopping trip, only the less attractive ones seemed to come in my size, and B) DAMN, posh bras are EXPENSIVE!!!!! I'm way too skint right now to justify spending that kind of money on bras that should only realistically see six months use and will be covered in milk or be in the laundry most of the time anyway.<br><br>So as much as I'm sure that after the baby is born I'd like to set fire to the unsexy maternity bras I currently own, instead I'm going to apply this nifty little trick of Valeri's and keep my maternity bras in rotation until either my boobs change shape/size or I give up breast feeding (assuming I'll be able to breast feed ok in the first place). Actually, I'm not sure I'll do the step that Valeri suggests of making the loop of fabric so that they are still adjustable. I may just apply the hooks and eyes and tether the straps at the length that they fit well at.<br><br>Anyways, apologies for going on about nursing bras and my recent deliberations for longer than was probably necessary. I hope that <a href="http://keepupwithusjones.blogspot.ca/2012/06/get-used-to-me-saying-bra-lot-in-this.html" target="_blank">Valeri's post</a> saves you or someone you know some money at some point in the future!</div>
