The pledges for #MMMay14 really are rolling in thick and fast. Plus all of you are clearly thinking carefully about the specifics of your own pledges to make them do-able but still challenging. The carefully thought-out ones are bound to be the most useful and interesting I reckon.<br><br>With less than a week to go until 1st May, I'm sure there are still some people who wish to take part in this year's challenge but are yet to sign up. As much as I'd like to highlight all the pledges so far, I'll just pick a few which may inspire those who are still mulling over what to commit to during May.<br><br><b><br></b><b>One garment a day too much?:</b><br><br>If you think that pledging to wear one self-stitched garment a day would be too much of a stretch, how about a different number of garments per week? Krafty Kat aims to wear five me-mades each week during May. If it's nippy, maybe she'll wear <a href="http://www.akraftykat.co.uk/corrine-cardigan/" target="_blank">her gorgeous recently finished Corrine cardigan </a>(pictured below). <br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Di5KT0nkVQ/U14W3LQI_YI/AAAAAAAAJ38/n0i9gumODho/s1600/kraftykat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Di5KT0nkVQ/U14W3LQI_YI/AAAAAAAAJ38/n0i9gumODho/s1600/kraftykat.jpg" height="400" width="300"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>(image source: <a href="http://www.akraftykat.co.uk/" target="_blank">A Krafty Kat</a>)</i><br><i><br></i><br><div style="text-align: left;"><b><br></b><b>Drowning in UFO's?:</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">If you've run out of steam mid-project and you're sick of them laying around, then why not make part of your pledge to finish them up during May? Mikhaela from <a href="http://www.polkadotoverload.com/" target="_blank">Polka Dot Overload</a> aims to use this year's challenge to do just that after having found that many of her previous makes no longer fit or have gone missing. Check out her beautifully colourful array of UFO's pictured below. I can't wait to see some of them completed and her wearing them before 1st June.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lvf9hkEOHoc/U14nbXxhtKI/AAAAAAAAJ4M/NgzXdu3Hi-M/s1600/polkadotoverload.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lvf9hkEOHoc/U14nbXxhtKI/AAAAAAAAJ4M/NgzXdu3Hi-M/s1600/polkadotoverload.jpg" height="300" width="400"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>(image source: <a href="http://www.polkadotoverload.com/" target="_blank">Polka Dot Overload</a>)</i></div></div><br><b><br></b><b>Already wear heaps of self-stitched clothes?:</b><br><br>Repeat-participater Maria, AKA <a href="http://www.cleverthinking99.com/" target="_blank">Velosewer&nbsp;from How Good Is That?</a>, has been sewing for a long time and already regularly wears her fabulous creations. However, she has cleverly thought out a pledge that will be both challenging and illuminating for herself: Maria pledges to&nbsp;wear me-made clothes that she hasn't worn more than once since sewn! Seeing as it's a brand new creation, I wonder if her latest black and houndstooth dress (pictured below) will do a turn during May...<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fwJ4Jw4B7Q4/U14xEyLYGvI/AAAAAAAAJ4c/G7t3aL3q8LE/s1600/velosewer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fwJ4Jw4B7Q4/U14xEyLYGvI/AAAAAAAAJ4c/G7t3aL3q8LE/s1600/velosewer.jpg" height="400" width="242"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>(image source: <a href="http://www.cleverthinking99.com/" target="_blank">How good it that?</a>)</i></div><br><b><br></b><b>Want to see if you're on the right track?:</b><br><br>If you've already been thinking a fair bit about what garments you make and why, Me-Made-May'14 could be a great opportunity to test those theories. For example,&nbsp;in addition to pledging to wearing&nbsp;at least one handmade garment and one handmade accessory every day,&nbsp;Becky from <a href="http://sew-and-so.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sew and So</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;also using this challenge to test out some of the conclusions she's come to while working through the Wardrobe Architect series hosted by Colette Patterns. Thankfully she's already figured out her <a href="http://sew-and-so.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/everyone-deserves-tea-dress.html" target="_blank">A-MAZING new tea dress</a> fits the bill!<br><br><b><br></b><b>Make things for other people?:</b><br><br>This challenge doesn't have to be all about you (but of course it can be!). If you regularly make things for your loved ones, you could take inspiration from Maider of <a href="http://masustak-eguzkitan.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Masustak Eguzkitan</a> who has not only upped her ante this year to wearing five garments per week herself, but once a week a friend or member of her family will also wear something made by her. I did something similar for <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/my-mmmay12-pledge.html" target="_blank">my pledge for Me-Made-May'12</a>. I found the&nbsp;logistics for documentary photography were challenging (which I chose to do but of course you do not have to), but the extra layer of participation was so much fun it was totally worth it.<br><br><br>I could go on and on... Each and every pledge that has been submitted so far is an inspiration, because it means that someone is taking an active step to improve their relationship with their wardrobe and their love of making clothes.</div>
