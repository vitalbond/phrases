Last week I realised that I didn't have anything with short sleeves to wear to preggers yoga. Oh, if only I could sew.... hahaha!!!!! So anyway, I made the T-shirt pictured above. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zOFEjX3lags/Ueg49ef7-NI/AAAAAAAAJTI/eLL8rzcC_lM/s1600/DSC00250-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zOFEjX3lags/Ueg49ef7-NI/AAAAAAAAJTI/eLL8rzcC_lM/s400/DSC00250-1.jpg" width="297"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I picked up the large navy spotty jersey dress in a charity a month or so back. In fact, I didn't buy it when I first saw it. I later realised I was a dumb arse and went back the next day, and thankfully it was still there. When visiting charity shops I've recently started to make a bee-line for the larger sized dresses as my first port of call. This dress is the perfect example of just how much sewable fabric you can get for your money. After washing and unpicking it I found I had sufficient fabric for a gathered-side maternity T-shirt will ample left for either a pair of undies or a baby garment of some description. Not bad for &pound;4.50, plus the fabric quality is really lovely.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E4cVjubZFpw/Ueg5oBxFxXI/AAAAAAAAJTQ/JjYZkrabXE4/s1600/DSC00251-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E4cVjubZFpw/Ueg5oBxFxXI/AAAAAAAAJTQ/JjYZkrabXE4/s400/DSC00251-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Anyways, this T-shirt is based on the basic self-drafted T-shirt pattern I made my <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/more-mid-maternity-stripes.html" target="_blank">striped long sleeve T-shirt</a> from (but with a slightly higher neckline and short sleeves) and adapted using my gathered-side maternity top technique (tutorial can be found <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/maternity-tops.html" target="_blank">here</a>). Because the front T-shirt pattern piece gets extended, the pattern piece ended up being a bit too long to cut in one from skirt section of this dress, so &nbsp;I cut it in two pieces, creating a seam across the front yoke area. I then disguised the seam with a length of red ric rac that I had in my stash which I think adds a nice little pop of colour as well. That's the thing with refashioning/remaking existing garments, you are often forced to be a bit more creative with your cutting than if you started from a flat piece of 'pure' fabric! Most of my sewing projects these days use fabric from my stash. But I occasionally I like to source some 'new-to-me' secondhand fabric or existing garment to start with. As my current stash becomes smaller, I imagine that increasingly I'll be looking to larger sized charity shop garments such as this for my sewing projects.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wG8NkxhdC2E/Ueg50C8dglI/AAAAAAAAJTY/Uwj4hZ2qMfM/s1600/DSC00262-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wG8NkxhdC2E/Ueg50C8dglI/AAAAAAAAJTY/Uwj4hZ2qMfM/s400/DSC00262-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So what about you?
