But it certainly feels as frumpy as the image often conjured up by the word 'muumuu'. Plus, unless my washing machine breaks down or a horrendous clothing-based accident occurs over the next five-ish weeks, this is the last maternity garment I'll be making for this pregnancy. Let's end on a low, hehehe!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGcJ56dy1TA/Uh4hgiPDnBI/AAAAAAAAJcA/VjrM-QOSRSs/s1600/DSC09941-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGcJ56dy1TA/Uh4hgiPDnBI/AAAAAAAAJcA/VjrM-QOSRSs/s400/DSC09941-1.jpg" width="301"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Those who have been following my previous pontifications on maternity garment sewing will have seen this Simplicity 3799 pattern (pictured above) crop up in posts a couple of times already. A few weeks ago I became very aware that I was due to go on a little holiday to Southern Spain in full-blown Summer, with bugger-all hot weather clothing to take. I reached for this pattern in somewhat of a panic, thinking its loose fitting nature and sleeveless-ness might provide some assistance in a hot climate. It also looked like a pretty simple make.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pY73egLA6c8/Uh4hCEVxitI/AAAAAAAAJb4/TNFXF7_Q5hM/s1600/DSC00289-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pY73egLA6c8/Uh4hCEVxitI/AAAAAAAAJb4/TNFXF7_Q5hM/s400/DSC00289-1.jpg" width="290"></a></div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I selected the size M (14-16) and adapted&nbsp;the front panel&nbsp;a bit by adding more fullness to accommodate my now-substantial bump. The size M's neck band ended up being a bit too wide than would be ideal, but considering how little I plan to wear this garment, I wasn't that fussed. It did, as predicted, stitch together really quickly. It's basically the same construction method as the sleeves version of&nbsp;<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2009/04/pattern-crush.html" target="_blank">my long lost pattern-crush, Simplicity 4589</a>. If the fabric is looking eerily familiar, it is because it is yet more of the synthetic slinky stuff (damn, I'm being so technically accurate today, this has virtually turned into a science blog!) that I made my <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/lady-like-pussy-bow-blouse.html" target="_blank">Lady-like pussy bow blouse</a> from. I may salvage the fabric from this garment and make something else from it one day.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Annoyingly (or thankfully) I didn't get any pictures of me wearing this whilst on holiday. But I can report that, despite feeling like Queen Frump of Frumpsville whilst wearing it, this dress did see quite a bit of use during the four days, especially worn over my maternity tankini going to and from the pool and to quickly cover up for my frequent night-time visits to the loo. Sisters who've experienced third-trimester pregnancy will what I'm talking' 'bout with that second point.&nbsp;</div></div>
