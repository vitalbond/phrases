I think their offerings would look something like my new smock top! In fact I don't think this top would look at all out of place in <a href="http://www.modcloth.com/" target="_blank">Modcloth</a>'s <a href="http://www.modcloth.com/shop/nautical-style" target="_blank">Nautical style selection</a>. I look at that damn website often enough, it was only a matter of time before their inspiration filtered down so directly into my creations.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yyj-oVuavJs/Ua9YZ9fnSbI/AAAAAAAAJHE/MVd0A9nFTl0/s1600/DSC00202-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yyj-oVuavJs/Ua9YZ9fnSbI/AAAAAAAAJHE/MVd0A9nFTl0/s400/DSC00202-1.jpg" width="297"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This smock top is my second attempt at the <a href="http://www.made-by-rae.com/washi/" target="_blank">Made by Rae Washi dress/tunic pattern</a>. I'm still totally I love with my first version of this pattern, <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/african-wax-fabric-washi-dress_28.html" target="_blank">my African Wax fabric Washi dress</a>, but sadly it didn't see many wears before my chest/bust expanded to deem it unwearable (thanks pregnancy hormones and increased oxygen requirements!). I'm sure it'll see more action in the future, post-birth and breast feeding, but I'm still currently lamenting its loss so I thought I'd have another whirl at the pattern.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xXijsraN6-c/Ua9Yw6i-vQI/AAAAAAAAJHU/ZMbzsQBFiWc/s1600/DSC00176-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xXijsraN6-c/Ua9Yw6i-vQI/AAAAAAAAJHU/ZMbzsQBFiWc/s400/DSC00176-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I went back to the drawing board, printed out another copy and this time cut out the Large rather than the Medium size. I wanted to use this lovely piece of pique cotton with zigzag border print that I got from <a href="http://sew-incidentally.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Claire</a> at the Walthamstow swap and meet-up earlier in the year, but its limited quantity restricted my style options a little. For example, I had to make the tunic rather than dress version (which I was happy with), however any kind of sleeves were pretty much out of the question. As cool as the border print was going to be, I wanted to add some more interest so created a faux-button stand/placket with navy ricrac stitched down along the edges and some awesome vintage navy and white buttons that have been languishing in my stash for far too long. The only purchase I made for this make (aside from the pattern itself, of course) was the ricrac as I didn't have any navy in my stash. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ISHre9UgLkI/Ua9YfwO46jI/AAAAAAAAJHM/hh3dM0q2JRg/s1600/DSC00203-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ISHre9UgLkI/Ua9YfwO46jI/AAAAAAAAJHM/hh3dM0q2JRg/s400/DSC00203-1.jpg" width="298"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I've already worn this top once on the last day of MMM'13 when I went to Madrid for the weekend. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that our current spell of sunshine lets me get more use from this top as it was a real joy to make, but I doubt will see any use post-maternity as it really is very 'smocky'! </div></div>
