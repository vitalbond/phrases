For this contest, entrants had to dig deeper than usual and really think about what garment they'd make using Offset Warehouse fabric to fulfil the brief of 'Everyday Awesome'. The entries were fantastic. I received lots interesting, ingenious and super-creative responses, many of which with beautiful illustrations to put across their plans. But sadly I could only choose one 'Everyday Awesome' finalist who will go on to receive the fabric of their choice to make the garment and enter the second phase of the contest against the other three finalists.<br><br>So the 'Everyday Awesome' finalist is.......<br><br><b><a href="http://createhopeinspire.blogspot.co.nz/" target="_blank">Miriam</a>!</b> Here's what she wrote:<br><br><i><b>'I would love to use the <a href="http://www.offsetwarehouse.com/eco-fabrics/all-fabrics-19/scarlet-hand-block-organic-cotton.html" target="_blank">hand blocked scarlet organic cotton</a>&nbsp;(pictured below) to make an everyday awesome dress.   My theory with dresses and fashion is all about everyday is a celebration, everyday is worth dressing up for, everyday is awesome. As a person I love to dress up and living through the thousands of earthquakes (in Christchurch, New Zealand) that destroyed so many possessions it has really confirmed to me the value of treasuring AND using your lovely things. If it's in your wardrobe wear it, or let someone else enjoy it. Not saving them only to find they are smashed in a disaster or eaten by a moth!&nbsp;</b></i><br><i><b><br></b></i><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6JFlj6H8_vQ/UyoFOruPSHI/AAAAAAAAJ0U/hIv19XmBL9c/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-19+at+20.58.51.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6JFlj6H8_vQ/UyoFOruPSHI/AAAAAAAAJ0U/hIv19XmBL9c/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-19+at+20.58.51.png"></a></div><i><b><br></b></i><i><b>I like the aesthetic of the hand blocked fabric and the colour but also I think something so lovely should be out and about everyday, also it tells it's own story, it should be touched and worn and it would look perfect on a bicycle. The little people at my sons' new school have started to ask me 'did you make that' as they chat to me.&nbsp;</b></i><br><i><b><br></b></i><i><b>It excites me that ethical fabric can be so beautiful and made into something that doesn't scream 'hippy dress', even though I am kind of a hippy!&nbsp;</b></i><br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G-PethSCnPk/Uyns3zYHp_I/AAAAAAAAJ0E/gbGFMboT1aA/s1600/miriam.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G-PethSCnPk/Uyns3zYHp_I/AAAAAAAAJ0E/gbGFMboT1aA/s1600/miriam.JPG" height="400" width="198"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i>(image source: <a href="http://createhopeinspire.blogspot.co.nz/" target="_blank">Create, Hope, Inspire</a>)</i></div><br><i><b><a href="http://createhopeinspire.blogspot.co.nz/2013/12/make-my-week-and-wardrobe-thursday.html" target="_blank">This is the pattern</a> I would use (pictured above). Halter neck, fullish skirt, 1950s style, not everyday for everyone but everyday for me. Living our lives car free in a new city - this dress would  tell a story that everyday is worth celebrating, ethical can be beautiful, and cycling can be done in style!'</b></i><br><i><b><br></b></i>I chose Miriam because her sentiments, about making the most of the possessions you have, have stayed with me every since I received her entry. I think everyone (myself firmly included) should be reminded every now and again that we only get one life so let's make the most of the lovely things we own by enjoying them everyday, and not save them for some special day that may never come. Every day is special (and awesome!)! I also really like her commitment to living an ethical lifestyle by riding a bike rather than driving a car around her city.<br><br>I really want to thank everyone who took the time to enter. I genuinely wish I could have got their choice of fabric sent to all of them so that everyone's idea of 'Everyday Awesome' could be actualised.<br><br>You can see the other three theme finalists on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Offset-Warehouse/120101571345842" target="_blank">Offset Warehouse's Facebook page</a>.  A list of my highly commended submissions will also be on there in the next few days - and you might be on it!  Also please don&rsquo;t forget to VOTE for Miriam (or one of the other three finalists) from the 9th April!!  The judging is open to public votes, and I really think she deserves to win, don't you?!</div>
