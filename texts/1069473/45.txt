It was very much an experiment I did last year when I had some spare time. I'd had some ideas floating round my head and I wanted to try and make them a reality, and while I don't think all the elements I've ploughed into this garment work in unison, I do think there are some good ideas in here that might inspire some more successful refashions in the future.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iUU6uVDCEG4/UgEJgtISTJI/AAAAAAAAJYE/wRupgQ2tr2k/s1600/DSC09392-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iUU6uVDCEG4/UgEJgtISTJI/AAAAAAAAJYE/wRupgQ2tr2k/s400/DSC09392-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So what<i> IS </i>going on here? Well, it's basically a bodice with a gathered strip of fabric to form a frill at the bottom that kind of brings a peplum effect. I wanted to try remaking a shirt with a princess seam bodice pattern rather than the usual bust dart shirt remakes I've made in the past. To be honest I can't remember which pattern I used, but any princess seam bodice pattern like the <a href="http://shop.byhandlondon.com/product/elisalex-dress" target="_blank">By Hand London's Elisalex dress</a> would be a good basis. I really like how the recutting of the shirt front slices up the original pocket detail (pictured below).&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tU7vdK2_A_o/UgEJl4HzE8I/AAAAAAAAJYM/VR5a5nwpHmE/s1600/DSC09391-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tU7vdK2_A_o/UgEJl4HzE8I/AAAAAAAAJYM/VR5a5nwpHmE/s400/DSC09391-1.jpg" width="298"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The frill was made from&nbsp;fabric harvested from the removed sleeves and seamed together to form&nbsp;a simple long rectangular strip. Plus, as you may have gathered, the cap sleeves are made from the original cuffs. I've seen this done better on other peoples' refashions! I think mine would have been better if the proportions were a bit more subtle, perhaps if I removed the buttons and brought the cuffs/caps in a bit so they don't protrude out as much.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zxTLlrRCkAQ/UgEKCA_Lk0I/AAAAAAAAJYU/4w5GHoCbE9E/s1600/DSC09389-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zxTLlrRCkAQ/UgEKCA_Lk0I/AAAAAAAAJYU/4w5GHoCbE9E/s400/DSC09389-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">But anyways. My intention was not to present you with a garment and then to list its flaws, I just wanted to show you the results of an experiment I had in the hope that an element or two from it might trigger some ideas for your own refashionings. Have a fabulous weekend.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><br></div>
