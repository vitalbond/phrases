The closing date is 16th March, AKA this Sunday, so you still have time to concoct an 'Everyday Awesome' garment, and/or something that fits with the other three themes that have been conjured up by the other blogger judges. You can enter once for each of the themes, so that's four chances to win the fabric of your choice and have a chance to go on to win a whole heap of amazing prizes.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SB-kkuuj1Ls/Ux8pCaLI4HI/AAAAAAAAJyQ/0_dQMEf57bg/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-11+at+15.17.11.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SB-kkuuj1Ls/Ux8pCaLI4HI/AAAAAAAAJyQ/0_dQMEf57bg/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-03-11+at+15.17.11.png"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Earlier today I was having a think about what my entry would consist of, if I were allowed to enter (which as one of the judges, I'm pretty sure I'm not!). I decided on using some of this lush looking <a href="http://www.offsetwarehouse.com/indigo-organic-denim-1286.html" target="_blank">Indigo organic chambray</a> (pictured above) to make an Everyday Awesome dress. I'm a bit late to the Chambray Party, I've only just begun to realise just how casually versatile it is. With the Indigo chambray, I'd use a vintage pattern that has been lurking in my stash for a couple of years, Simplicity 6795 (pictured below) that was published in 1974. I'd probably use a contrast red binding and red buttons to make the whole thing pop.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HEDj1TXO1B4/Ux8qIUBt3gI/AAAAAAAAJyY/9EWUVGqcdNs/s1600/photo-12.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HEDj1TXO1B4/Ux8qIUBt3gI/AAAAAAAAJyY/9EWUVGqcdNs/s1600/photo-12.jpg" height="400" width="298"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I always feel really put-together and special in a dress but I so rarely wear them, particularly during the day. They look like you've made lots of effort, even though to create an outfit with a dress involves much less mix-and-matching than with separates. I'd spend quite a bit of time toiling and fitting the bodice to get a really comfortable and flattering fit so I'd never be put off from wearing it. Plus, I think this dress would span quite a range of temperatures and weather conditions depending how you wore it: just with flip flops and sunglasses in the Summer, or layered with a vest, cardigan, opaque tights and boots for colder months. That's a whole load of potential Awesome I'd be injecting into my Everyday wear.....</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So if you haven't already entered, what would your Everyday Awesomeness garment/outfit consist of?
