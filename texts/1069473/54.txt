There's going to be a whole lot more&nbsp;blog posts about baby clothes&nbsp;round these parts from here on out. I can promise you that this blog will NOT become exclusively about baby clothes. Plus, I can promise you that the baby clothes that do get blogged about will bring a whole heap of cuteness with them. But if you really can't stand babies/kids and baby/kid stuff then I totally understand that you may wish to look away now and un-follow this blog for the next 18 years or so.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2RzzR7t1rMo/UjAsam6L3TI/AAAAAAAAJec/US8w-FShoHw/s1600/DSC00309-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2RzzR7t1rMo/UjAsam6L3TI/AAAAAAAAJec/US8w-FShoHw/s400/DSC00309-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><br>Anyone still there? Ah good! I certainly won't stop making my own clothing, umm, ever, but if our recent flat move taught me anything it is that I have A LOT of clothes already. Plus, the time I'll have to devote to sewing is about to be violently curtailed with the arrival of our little Missy so it makes sense to get into making some quicker projects that will still give me the same sense of completion. And damn these nappy cover/pants were quick! They took about 30-45 mins each, plus I have a cold at the moment so wasn't working at full capacity. And not only quick, but cheap! Each pair used up a smallish piece of fabric from my scraps bag and I used elastic from my stash. Free pants!<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hLRQA1SxU04/UjAs1d9gwpI/AAAAAAAAJek/nXfmxXTKN00/s1600/DSC00307-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hLRQA1SxU04/UjAs1d9gwpI/AAAAAAAAJek/nXfmxXTKN00/s400/DSC00307-1.jpg" width="297"></a></div><br>I have the lovely Catherine to thank for the pattern, the same reader&nbsp;<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/baby-trousers.html" target="_blank">who loaned me the copy of Ottobre</a>&nbsp;magazine&nbsp;that started a new obsession. I've kind of decided that I'd prefer to keep Missy in jersey/knit garments for much of her first year for comfort and ease of movement, but I thought that some soft woven fabric nappy covers like these when paired with a baby vest/onesie might be good for warm days spent at home in the flat. In fact, they might prove particularly useful if I end up following <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/150026231309928407/" target="_blank">this idea of turning outgrown vests/onesies into t-shirts</a> in the name of longevity. Who can say right now? I've got a BIG learning curve ahead of me, and what to put the baby in is just one tiny fraction of it!<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nll9z616IQg/UjAs-T0K2yI/AAAAAAAAJes/0eaJRdslitE/s1600/DSC00310-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="297" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nll9z616IQg/UjAs-T0K2yI/AAAAAAAAJes/0eaJRdslitE/s400/DSC00310-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><br>Anyways, I changed the pattern slightly to remove the frilly hem element, making them look more like some fancy, expensive ones I saw for sale in a fancy, expensive maternity and baby shop in Brighton. The casino pair will be perfect for when we host poker games. Those are a size 'Small' which will allegedly fit 3-6 months babies. The other two are a size 'Medium' which apparently spans 6-18 months, which seems quite a tall order for just one size and they do seem mighty big. But I guess there's only one way to find out (= finding a baby's bum to put them on!). I may need to tighten up the waist elastic at some point.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hD0i9W-MhXs/UjAtGZVbrJI/AAAAAAAAJe0/6ZbEBEyMGSs/s1600/DSC00314-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hD0i9W-MhXs/UjAtGZVbrJI/AAAAAAAAJe0/6ZbEBEyMGSs/s400/DSC00314-1.jpg" width="297"></a></div><br>On the back of each pair I've stitched a little label that I had left over from when I used to dabble in making and embellishing baby clothes to sell a squillion years ago. The sizes on the labels don't really correspond with the size of the pants but I thought it would be useful to be able to figure out which way round the pants are meant to be worn at a glance whilst you are trying to wrangle a wriggling baby. See? Always thinking, me...</div>
