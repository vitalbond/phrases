<div>Oh hi sewing-competition fans! Ethical fabric purveyors,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.offsetwarehouse.com/" target="_blank">Offset Warehouse</a>, have just launched the <a href="http://www.offsetwarehouse.com/the-big-spring-contest.html" target="_blank">Big Spring Contest</a>, and guess what...? I&rsquo;m one of the blogger judges! Hurrah! Want to win some fabric and a whole bunch more stuff? Of course you do. Read on, friends...<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BGEUOPiWCKA/UxORclZC6nI/AAAAAAAAJuo/2_bGvmXbFNk/s1600/PROMO+SpringContestmainWEB.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BGEUOPiWCKA/UxORclZC6nI/AAAAAAAAJuo/2_bGvmXbFNk/s1600/PROMO+SpringContestmainWEB.jpg" height="306" width="400"></a></div><br>As one of the judges, I&rsquo;ve been asked to come up with a theme and judge all the entrants for that theme.  I get to pick one lucky winner who will get sent the fabric of their choice to make their design in three weeks. If you are selected as the overall winner out of the four 'theme finalists', you will win a whole goodie-bag of prizes!<br><br>The theme I've come up with is&nbsp;<b>'Everyday Awesomeness':</b>&nbsp;garments that you wear day in day out that make you feel great, whatever that means to you. To enter, let me know what you would like to sew for the theme of 'Everyday Awesomeness' using fabric from the <a href="http://www.offsetwarehouse.com/" target="_blank">Offset Warehouse</a>. You could choose an existing sewing pattern, commercial or self-drafted; you could adapt an existing sewing pattern; or you could design something entirely from scratch. Whatever you come up with, if chosen, you will need to be able to actually make the garment design you have submitted. Make sense?<br><br>To submit your idea, please email me your 'Everyday Awesomeness' idea&nbsp;by Sunday 16th March to sozoblog (at) gmail (dot) com. Your entry could be a link to which existing pattern you'd use, a sketch of a new design idea, a photograph: basically whatever you want as long as it adequately conveys to me what you would like to make. Along with your design/pattern choice, you must include details of which Offset Warehouse fabric you&rsquo;d make it with, plus a sentence or two explaining what's 'everyday-awesome' about your submission. Please include 'Big Spring Contest' in the subject line of your email.<br><br>After that date I will choose a finalist who will be sent the fabric/s they need to make their garment. After those garments have been made and judged, an overall winner from the four theme finalists will then be chosen to win the goodies.<br><br>To get started, have a browse on <a href="http://www.offsetwarehouse.com/" target="_blank">Offset Warehouse's site</a> and see what fabric inspires you!
