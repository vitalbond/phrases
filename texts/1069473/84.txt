An awesome idea Jen came up with was writing about creating clothing for the seasons we are coming into as May descends in our corners of the globe. You can read Jen's fascinating take on creating clothing for Autumn/Winter in the Southern Hemisphere<a href="http://www.jenniferlaurenvintage.com/2014/05/sewing-for-season.html" target="_blank"> here</a>. Which left me thinking about the weather we currently have here in the Northern Hemisphere and how best to fill our wardrobes with suitable clothing...</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;">I swiftly realised that that is just too big a topic to cover! The Mays I enjoyed whilst living in Barcelona for example, are no doubt entirely different to the Mays going on in Canada, for example. So I thought it would be interesting to throw the question out to various points of the Northern Hemisphere's blogosphere: 'How do you approach clothing to make and wear for around this time of the year?'. Just to clarify that despite the title of this post, I'm of course not just talking about sewing, I just can't resist a bit of alliteration.&nbsp;</div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0idsbVjX9B4/U2Z3ytnY4DI/AAAAAAAAJ4s/1rSZ1pS4Mas/s1600/DSCN8127.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0idsbVjX9B4/U2Z3ytnY4DI/AAAAAAAAJ4s/1rSZ1pS4Mas/s1600/DSCN8127.JPG" height="400" width="265"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i>(image source: <a href="http://roobeedoo.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Roobeedoo</a>)</i></div><br><a href="http://roobeedoo.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ruth in Scotland</a>&nbsp;(pictured above):<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>"Spring (or Summer) in Northern Scotland can sometimes feel more like a Southern English winter.

I usually spend a lot of the month traveling around the US, selling my husband&rsquo;s photography, visiting friends and camping out in various cities and parks, and with my wardrobe limited by what will fit in our truck (read more about our life on the road <a href="http://tashamillergriffith.com/2013/08/22/life-as-artists-on-the-road/" target="_blank">here</a>).  I feel like adding travel just adds another level of unpredictability to what is already a transitional time with a lot of varied weather.  My strategy for what to make and wear for all of this is what I learned growing up in the mountain Southwest, where temps vary hugely from day to night: dress in layers.  I have several lightweight tops, a couple of sweaters and a soft jacket that I can wear all together under my rain jacket if it&rsquo;s really cold, or in various other combinations.

Last year, we had more cool and rainy days in May than usual, and I wore these pants/trousers all the time.  I think a good pair of pants is essential for transitional weather, they work for warmer and cooler days (with different tops of course) and even with long johns underneath if it&rsquo;s cold.

Last year was very cold and rainy, this year it will probably be very warm if April is an indicator. In addition, the temperature shifts a lot during the day. Mornings and evenings are still quite cold while it might already be summery during the day. So it is necessary here to wear layers most days that work for walking to work in the morning as well as sitting in the warm office during the day. Since it is often still too cold for bare legs, my usual outfit consists of pants, T-shirt/top and a light jacket or blazer. After the long winter I'm always really sick of dark colours and thus I tend to go for light/pastel colours during this time. I also noticed that I really gravitate towards floral prints once it gets warmer. Pieces I have worn a lot last spring/summer were <a href="http://www.sewionista.com/2013/06/me-made-mittwoch-26-juni-2013.html" target="_blank">these floral pants</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.sewionista.com/2013/07/me-made-outfit-09-juli-2013.html" target="_blank">this white jacket</a>. The colours and print of the pants put me instantly in a good mood and they work well with differents tops. The jacket is made from cotton and unlined, which makes it perfect for spring/summer and in white it fits into every spring/summer outfit. I also really like this type of short jacket/blazer because it can be combined with pants as well as with skirts and dresses.&nbsp;</i></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>When I plan a new wardrobe for a new season, it helps me to <a href="http://www.sewionista.com/2014/01/nahliste-fur-die-ubergangszeit-sewing.html" target="_blank">create a Polyvore-board</a> of my sewing plan. This prevents me from getting distracted or sidetracked which normally happens a lot with all the great inspiration on the blogosphere. It is important for me that the pieces on my sewing plan complete my already existing wardrobe and can be combined with each other. They also have to fit my life and style, which is mostly casual as I don't have to follow any dress code at work."</i></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i><br></i></b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AfEyPz_rg8s/U2Z89N6r5yI/AAAAAAAAJ5U/Ym4dPs0WW5c/s1600/PicMonkey+Collage+bar+counter+dress.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AfEyPz_rg8s/U2Z89N6r5yI/AAAAAAAAJ5U/Ym4dPs0WW5c/s1600/PicMonkey+Collage+bar+counter+dress.jpg" height="203" width="400"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>(image source: <a href="http://aventurasdecosturas.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Aventuras de Costuras</a>)</i></div><br><a href="http://aventurasdecosturas.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Merche in Southern Spain</a> (pictured above):&nbsp; <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>"Where I live, in the South of Spain, Spring is almost non-existent. That means you go from wearing your coat one day and in a week's time you'll be dressed in your summer clothes. That usually happens in the middle of May. Up in the North is a complete different thing: you always, always need a light cardigan or a jacket to have around when the night falls. One garment that I made and find very useful and wearable during this Spring-Summer period is a maxi dress I wore on many occasions. I think that due to the neutral colours and the shape of it, it can easily go from formal with high heels and a shiny bolero as I wore it to a wedding, to more hippy-like style with a denim jacket and flip-flops.
