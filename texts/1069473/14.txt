Here is another celebratory giveaway courtesy of a fabulous new sewing website called <a href="http://www.thepolishedbutton.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Polished Button</a>. You may be questioning the need for <i>another</i> website selling sewing products, but this one is special. They aim to offer a ‘one stop shop’ where you can find authentic and vintage inspired fabrics, haberdashery and patterns all in one place. So if you are into sewing vintage/retro looks, or simply fancy finding something a bit different from the usual sewing department offerings, <a href="http://www.thepolishedbutton.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Polished Button</a> is a great place to visit on a regular basis. Personally, I've found the site to be well-designed, easy to navigate and the stock well curated. And the owner is super-sweet and very helpful, plus she's crazy-knowledgable about all things vintage. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6hWyImAQGpo/UZZALHhRnBI/AAAAAAAAJA0/_AlHlkEk3ZU/s1600/close+up.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6hWyImAQGpo/UZZALHhRnBI/AAAAAAAAJA0/_AlHlkEk3ZU/s400/close+up.jpg" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>The Prize:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The Polished Button are very generously offering a fabulous prize for one lucky winner consisting of 1 metre of this lovely and unusual <a href="http://www.thepolishedbutton.co.uk/shop/black-white-gingham-star-print-cotton/" target="_blank">black and white star detail gingham fabric</a> (pictured above) plus a set of four matching black vintage buttons (pictured below). </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>How to Enter:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This giveaway is open to everyone, at no cost to yourselves.
