I think it's kind of a shame that once a giveaway's closing date has passed, and if you weren't lucky enough to have been a winner, that's often the last you hear of it, so I thought a little update was in order. If you entered the giveaway in question, you'll remember that <a href="http://sewbox.co.uk/">Sewbox.co.uk</a> were generously offering up two prizes: 1) a sewing pattern of your choice and, 2) 1 metre of fabric of your choice from their range. The winners were selected by random and sent their prizes. I'm really pleased to report that the winner of her choice of fabric, Jennavive, was awesome enough to send me a picture of the garment she made with her prize (see below)!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l7M73XeQO5g/Ua-jJHWsCOI/AAAAAAAAJHs/kvpj0bWFB-g/s1600/DSCF1760.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l7M73XeQO5g/Ua-jJHWsCOI/AAAAAAAAJHs/kvpj0bWFB-g/s400/DSCF1760.JPG" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I didn't check every single entry link, but it seemed that all those who entered to win some fabric picked a Liberty print as their favourite. Liberty print seems to be like crack to sewers! Anyway, I have to say that, although not a <i>huge</i> fan of Liberty prints myself, I personally think <a href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/fabrics/liberty-fabrics/liberty-tana-lawn-ltl03632019j.html" target="_blank">Jennavive's choice</a> was one of the nicest! </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Using a pattern that is <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/tie-collar-shirt-blouse.html" target="_blank">close to my own heart</a> (Newlook 6808), I think her blouse is so pretty and wearable, as well as being a fabulous use of a limited quantity of fabric. The solid coloured contrast collar is a touch of genius, and look at how neat the finish of this blouse is?! Phenom. Massive thanks to Jennavive for sending me the picture of her creation and for allowing me the pleasure of sharing it here on my blog, and of course to Sewbox.co.uk for providing the prizes.</div></div>
