Then there was <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/samuels-baby-quilt.html" target="_blank">Samuel's</a>. Now comes the hat-trick! You remember my mate Anna for whom <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/more-maternity-madness-some-selfless.html" target="_blank">I made a couple of maternity garments</a> recently? Well she had her little baby!!!! A little boy called Theo who, if the photo on Facebook is to believed, is CUTE! Sadly, Theo and his folks live in Madrid so it's going to be a while until I get to meet that little chap in the flesh, by which point I'll have my own new little person for Theo to hang with.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQRDk9CRj5Q/UkLy9Hwc3LI/AAAAAAAAJjE/eIeyu7MctuM/s1600/DSC00189-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tQRDk9CRj5Q/UkLy9Hwc3LI/AAAAAAAAJjE/eIeyu7MctuM/s400/DSC00189-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><br>I actually finished this quilt back in May to take with me when <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/more-maternity-madness-some-selfless.html" target="_blank">we went to Madrid to visit</a>. Anna and her husband Marcus chose not to find out the gender of their baby before the birth, so I had to make it gender-neutral. I also wanted to give this one a fairly fun, contemporary look so I kept that in mind when hunting out fabric scraps to make it from.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gX12MRC30nM/UkLzIu9IPkI/AAAAAAAAJjM/nmBzAZEWT2w/s1600/DSC00192-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gX12MRC30nM/UkLzIu9IPkI/AAAAAAAAJjM/nmBzAZEWT2w/s400/DSC00192-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><br>Technique-wise, it's made in more or less EXACTLY the same way as the previous two. If it ain't broke... It's backed with red fleece which, along with the wadding, were the only bits that I needed to actually buy. The patchwork fabric pieces came from a combination of my own fabric stash and the scraps hamper at <a href="http://sewoverit.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sew Over It</a>. I think the only thing I did differently with the construction of this quilt is that I hand-stitched the second edge of the binding rather than using my sewing machine as I did with the previous two. This red bias binding is narrower than the other two's self-made binding so I decided it would be less of a headache to stitch it down by hand. I'm actually really pleased with how neat I was able to stitch it.<br><br>So, you may be wondering, is there a fourth quilt in the pipeline....?!</div>
