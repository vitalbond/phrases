A couple of weeks ago I published <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/deep-maternity-sewing-thoughts-please.html" target="_blank">a post with all my maternity sewing patterns</a> that I've collated and I asked my lovely readers' opinions about which they thought would be worth sewing up. Thanks to all for adding their tupp'ny worth! Many favoured the Vogue 7382, as did I, and when I discovered some amazing eyeball-print African Wax fabric in my stash of a sufficient quantity needed for View C, that is what I went ahead and made. The result:<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YOkt8Igg40M/UeWGltG_tOI/AAAAAAAAJSA/r94jR-C5p6U/s1600/DSC00264-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YOkt8Igg40M/UeWGltG_tOI/AAAAAAAAJSA/r94jR-C5p6U/s400/DSC00264-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I laughed my arse off for literally 10 minutes. Then Pat came in to see what the hysteria was all about and then we laughed our combined arse off for a further 10 minutes. Would it shock you to learn that I didn't bother to do any kind of mid-way fitting?! Unlikely. To be honest, I felt something was going awry as I was attaching the skirt section to the bodice. There wasn't anything like the amount of fullness in the gathering that the illustration lead me to believe there would be. It was more like a few little tucks rather than a baby-doll gathered empire-line effect. But I couldn't be arsed to get Pat to pin me in to see what was going on, so I carried on and even hand-picked the zip in (my machine is massively playing up at the moment and wouldn't let me machine-stitch the zip in place).&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So with the zip in I finally tried it on! To be honest, I'm not particularly bothered that this is an epic fail. I'd already eliminated the neck-hole and armhole facings in favour of a simpler overlock, turn and stitch method. I certainly cannot be arsed to unpick the dress and re-fit the bodice and finish it off. It didn't take me long to get to this point and I had a good laugh over it, so I think I'm going to throw it back on my fabric shelves and use the fabric for something else one day. Oh, and in case you hadn't noticed, further humour can be derived from the fact that somehow I'd managed to place one of the most prominent eyeballs right over my belly button!:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RMlTH2yyY3o/UeWJfCGkPFI/AAAAAAAAJSQ/7qDr4FaOLPo/s1600/DSC00266-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RMlTH2yyY3o/UeWJfCGkPFI/AAAAAAAAJSQ/7qDr4FaOLPo/s400/DSC00266-1.jpg" width="298"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So, have we all calmed down a bit now?! I just about have. Looking at the pictures just made me crack up all over again. That incident would have been a bit depressing if I hadn't already finished another, infinitely more successful, maternity dress creation a couple of days before!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9d9Tgl1ihXU/UeWLBP-7oMI/AAAAAAAAJSg/MDvYup4tMkc/s1600/black+dress.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9d9Tgl1ihXU/UeWLBP-7oMI/AAAAAAAAJSg/MDvYup4tMkc/s400/black+dress.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Just as I threatened to do in <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/maternity-wardrobe-six-months.html" target="_blank">my last post</a>, I whipped up another version of my <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/nautical-jersey-dress.html" target="_blank">nautical batwing dress</a>. This solid black dress is the same in shape albeit for two small changes: it's longer and therefore hopefully a bit more ladylike (seeing as I am no longer meant to be sitting with my legs crossed!) and the neckline is the same in the front and back. I wanted a more slash-neck style for this one so didn't lower it at the front like I usually do when making my batwing creations. This has had the unexpected benefit of making the dress reversible! Being black, I've found since making it that it gets marks on it easily. Being reversible means I can get a bit more wear from it before chucking it in the wash. Call me a skank if you will, but when you have a very limited selection of clothes that currently fit you, benefits like that go a long way!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vfZyqo67fuk/UeWW4YB085I/AAAAAAAAJSw/1kKgQKxUzNM/s1600/photo+(3).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vfZyqo67fuk/UeWW4YB085I/AAAAAAAAJSw/1kKgQKxUzNM/s400/photo+(3).jpg" width="302"></a></div></div>
