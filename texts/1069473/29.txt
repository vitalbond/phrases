Whether it be your own child, grandchild, niece or nephew, a friend's progeny or anyone else's, there is something about a tiny person that frequently seems to inspire the desire to make something. Maybe it's the relative freedom of a project for someone with no set sartorial preferences, or the irresistible draw to make something so small and cute. Or maybe it's something deeper: a desire to provide warmth, comfort and/or fun for the child using your own two hands rather than simply your debit card. If at some point I'd started a tally, by now I would have lost count of the number of participants in the Me-Made/Self-Stitched challenges that left a comment to the effect of <i>'I got into sewing/knitting for my kids, and now I want to focus on making some things for myself so I'm signing up to this challenge to help me do that'</i>.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o2_m0Kw6H5I/UcQzyMGw-xI/AAAAAAAAJMY/dyzHN_RsLJw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-06-21+at+12.06.11.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o2_m0Kw6H5I/UcQzyMGw-xI/AAAAAAAAJMY/dyzHN_RsLJw/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-06-21+at+12.06.11.png" width="400"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>(<a href="http://www.littledresskits.co.uk/product/tie-side-pinafore-apron/#prettyPhoto" target="_blank">Reversible Tie-Side Pinafore Kit</a>)</i></div><br>But sometimes the desire to create for yours or someone else's kids is there, but it can be difficult to know where to start. That's where <a href="http://www.littledresskits.co.uk/" target="_blank">Little Dress Kits</a> come in. They design, make and sell project packs containing everything that you'll need to make a super cute, great quality garment for a baby or toddler&nbsp;(excluding the equipment: you'll need scissors, a sewing machine, hand-sewing needle and pins).&nbsp;When I say everything, I'm talking the pattern, full instructions, all fabric, thread, trims, buttons etc. plus a little garment label to give a polished finish. All the hunting down of materials and figuring out how much to buy of each has been done for you, leaving you to focus on the fun bit: making!!! I can't help but feel this is a perfect solution for someone who hasn't got the time or desire to spend half a weekend trawling fabric and haberdashery shops. Plus if you tot up how much a new commercial sewing pattern plus good quality fabric plus thread, notions etc. would be to buy individually, these all-inclusive kits probably work out quite a bit cheaper.&nbsp;The kits are also graded by difficulty to help you select the most appropriate product so you can avoid starting something a bit too advanced and the frustration of getting stuck!<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ERnWvTxRvoI/UcSHrjdEeQI/AAAAAAAAJMo/sABueOjiSas/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-06-21+at+18.03.25.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="361" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ERnWvTxRvoI/UcSHrjdEeQI/AAAAAAAAJMo/sABueOjiSas/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-06-21+at+18.03.25.png" width="400"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">(<i><a href="http://www.littledresskits.co.uk/product/little-gentlemans-waistcoat-kit/#prettyPhoto" target="_blank">Little Waistcoat Kit</a></i>)</div><br>If you are already a keen sewer (and if you are a regular reader of this blog, it's more than possible that you are), but have someone in your life who is always giving you the old <i>'Oh, I wish I could sew',</i> routine, a gift of one of these <a href="http://www.littledresskits.co.uk/" target="_blank">Little Dress Kits</a> could start them off on their own sewing journey (without you needing to hold their hand through the process!!). Katie at Little Dress Kits was kind enough to let me choose a kit to have a go at myself. I picked the <a href="http://www.littledresskits.co.uk/product/needlecord-and-gingham-dungarees-with-heart-buttons/" target="_blank">Sweet Heart Dungarees kit</a> as I didn't know the gender of my baby when she emailed me and it looked like a fairly gender-neutral option (my version is pictured below). Therefore I can say for sure that these kits are very well designed and the instructions are thorough without being overly complicated. Frustratingly, I've got at least a year to wait until my dungarees will actually get worn!!!<br><br>I would also say that one fantastic feature of the kits is this: if you retain the pattern pieces and instructions, what's stopping you from making lots more versions? If instead of giving a friend a shop-bought child's garment you gave them one of these kits, it's kind of like 'give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, teach him how to fish...'. If you see what I mean!<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-45aV6Dl88Rk/UcSJMluYaeI/AAAAAAAAJM4/rRWbNhjxmOM/s1600/DSC00242-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-45aV6Dl88Rk/UcSJMluYaeI/AAAAAAAAJM4/rRWbNhjxmOM/s400/DSC00242-1.jpg" width="301"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">However, I'm not writing this post just to show-off my good fortune at being given a kit for nowt, Katie from Little Dress Kits's generosity extends further still and is offering one of my blog readers a kit of their choice FOR FREE!!!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>The Prize:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">One Little Dress Kit of your choice from <a href="http://www.littledresskits.co.uk/shop/" target="_blank">their range</a>&nbsp;(there are eight to choose from).
