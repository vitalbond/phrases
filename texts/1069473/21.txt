So along with a whole bunch of other UK-based bloggers (300 in total), I've been invited to be part of Pinterest's 'Pin It Forward' campaign. Their aim is to get more peops in the UK using Pinterest and are getting UK bloggers from a variety of interests to help them do this. I admit that basically I'm in love with using Pinterest for gathering and sharing visual inspiration, but I'm not a selfish lover (!) and I'm up for helping others who have yet to discover its joys so I agreed to get involved.<br><br>So for those who haven't figure it out yet, basically Pinterest is a website that you sign up to for free on which you can create pin-boards of things that interest you. You can gather 'pins' to put on your board from Pinterest itself (either by following other members whos's taste you appreciate or by using their search tool), from other places on the internet, or by uploading your own pictures.<br><br><a data-pin-do="embedBoard" href="http://pinterest.com/zozowahine/refashioning-project-ideas/"></a> <br><br>I find it is really helpful to collate all my visual inspiration together on various Pinterest boards, rather than having all those images scattered in various image files, bookmarked links and so forth. It's helped me in obvious ways (like being more organised and able to trace the source of an image quickly, for example), and in more unexpected ones too (for example, like pinning lots of images of outfits I like then seeing them collated together and being able to analyse what trends come through).<br><br>One of my most <a href="http://pinterest.com/zozowahine/" target="_blank">beloved boards</a> I've been carefully curating is my imaginatively-titled '<a href="http://pinterest.com/zozowahine/refashioning-project-ideas/" target="_blank">Refashioning Project Ideas</a>' (there's a snippet of it pictured above). It's full of what I consider to be the coolest, loveliest, prettiest, quirkiest and most wearable refashioning/upcycling/remaking clothing and accessories projects I've come across. <br><br>If you haven't got involved yet and fancy a piece of the Pinterest-action, a quick and easy way for you to join up can be found <a href="http://pinterest.com/join/?username=zozowahine&boardname=refashioning-project-ideas" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
