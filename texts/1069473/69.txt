This dress style is a gorgeous, updated version of a vintage look that I guarantee looks amazing in both printed and solid fabrics. In fact, this pattern is close to my heart as it is one of the classes that I have taught at 'Sew Over It's' bricks and mortar shop/sewing school in South London, plus I helped develop the instructions for this pattern. Check out Lisa's delightful peaches and cream silk version pictured below, plus you can see my black version of this pattern <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/1940s-pin-up-tea-dress.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br><b>How to Enter:</b><br><br>There are three copies of this pattern up for grabs. This giveaway/competition is open internationally and with no cost to yourselves. All you have to do is help 'Sew Over It' decide which of their in-the-flesh classes they should release as a sewing pattern next. So head over to <a href="http://sewoverit.co.uk/lessons/browse-by-classes/" target="_blank">the classes page</a> of their website and decide which garment you'd most like to be made available as a pattern and leave a comment in the comment box of this post.
