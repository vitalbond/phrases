The amount of wonderful inspiration and friendly support provided by the other participants is something that can't be beaten, and the rest of the year doesn't feel quite a vibrant by contrast! BUT, there's a whole year of makery ahead that will hopefully be inspired and directed by what we have learnt from this year's challenge, edging us ever closer a wardrobe full of handmade delights that express our personal style, fit with our lifestyle and flatter our physique.<br><br><br>Practical things I achieved during MMMay'14:<br><br><br><ul><li>I found time to repair my <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/school-boy-trousers.html" target="_blank">school boy trousers</a> where holes had started to appear through excess wear.

This t-shirt fits me well and is lots of fun and the trousers are the most comfortable I own whilst still being flattering)</i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><br></i></div><br>Things I've learnt from MMMay'14:<br><br><br><ul><li>When I was creating my pledge, I thought I'd be able to use this challenge to get back to wearing clothing that <b>reflects my personal style</b> more than I have been recently. Very soon in to the challenge I realised that the realities of mumming a baby and the practicalities of breast feeding meant that wasn't really going to happen as I had envisaged.&nbsp;</li><li>I realised how much I'd got into <b>rut in recent months</b> of grabbing the same clothes that I wore the previous day if they were still clean. There's nothing inherently wrong with doing that of course, but as someone who really enjoys clothing and expressing themselves by deciding 'who I was going to be today', it kind of makes me feel pretty far from who I used to be. This challenge made me more mindful of getting dressed, albeit in a limited manner compared to previous years, and helped me <b>shake up my outfits</b> a bit from day to day and I think that I will continue to do so going forward.&nbsp;</li><li>I have a <b>great selection</b> of casual, comfortable me-made clothing. Keeping on top of laundry is a challenge in itself these days, with a baby who is being weened onto solid foods and is going through two or three outfit changes a day, plus no outside space to get clothes dried. However, I have a sufficient quantity of jersey tops and some comfortable trousers and skirts that <b>mix and match well</b>. My continuing obsession with navy, red, mustard-yellow, black and grey (plus strips and leopard print!) means that I don't have any clothing orphans and my separates can make a squillion outfits when put in different combinations. This is through luck not planning but I am grateful for it and I hope it continues.&nbsp;</li><li>I really enjoy making useful things for Dolores that she gets lots of use from. I have soooo many plans for making garments for her, but that's another blog post...</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5kDBm-8s-WA/U4zXEV9XEfI/AAAAAAAAKFg/pW_52P_Qm7U/s1600/006-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5kDBm-8s-WA/U4zXEV9XEfI/AAAAAAAAKFg/pW_52P_Qm7U/s1600/006-1.jpg" height="400" width="300"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>(Most worn garment of the month: <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/captain-jacket.html" target="_blank">Captain jacket</a>!

I plan to refashion/remake these into garments for Dolores or send take them to the textile recycling bank.&nbsp;</li><li>A few day appropriate dresses would be really nice addition to my wardrobe selection to help me feel a bit more 'put together', but that's something I'll focus on more closely once I have stopped breast feeding during the day.&nbsp;</li><li>I'd also like to make at least one pair of shorts and maybe a stretchy skirt which I can run after a baby in!</li><li>Lots of clothes for Dolores! By next year I hope she will be wearing something made by me everyday and join me in each documentation photo.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Thank you all so much for checking out my personal challenge and for the lovely and supportive comments you left. If you took part, I hope it was illuminating and fun for you. Here's to #MMMay15!&nbsp;</div></div></div>
