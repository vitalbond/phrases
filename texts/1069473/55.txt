<div>I don't know about you, but where I live Autumn has arrived with a bang. As lovely as Summer has been, I LOVE the 'Back to School' refocusing on plans and head-clearing freshness that early Autumn brings. And being a heavily pregnant lady this time round, I'm vastly appreciative of the slight new coolness in the air.<br><br>The change in season from Summer to Autumn also brings the need to rediscover some warmer garments. Maybe you feel the desire for some new wardrobes additions but haven't got the cash, time or inclination to make something from scratch? Umm, then let's get our refashion on! Refashioning existing garments is almost always cheaper AND quicker than embarking on a from-scratch sewing project, and if you are stuck for inspiration then take a look below at some ideas from the archives of my '<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/p/refashion-resource.html" target="_blank">Refashion Resource' page</a>:<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/refashion-friday-inspiration-leather.html" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xiyszYMrBOw/UjItjGcxp9I/AAAAAAAAJfE/e4Li8NlgrYM/s400/DSC09258-1.jpg" width="298"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/refashion-friday-inspiration-leather.html" target="_blank"> Leather Moustache Appliqu&eacute; Jumper remake</a> combines a knitwear re-hash with a super-simple appliqu&eacute;d design. Whatever design imagery you are into at the moment (narwhals? elks? garden gnomes?) could be easily translated in this manner.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/refashion-friday-inspiration-contrast.html#" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAfNXnXScl0/UjIvmUt6yYI/AAAAAAAAJfQ/X6LgJ05x2Xw/s400/DSC08816-1.jpg" width="297"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Does anything say Autumn like a checked/plaid shirt?! Then how about taking an expected tack by combining one with a denim shirt and trowing in a cute collar detail for added interest? Check out <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/refashion-friday-inspiration-contrast.html#" target="_blank">the Contrast Yoke Shirt with Petal Collar</a> project for more details.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/refashion-friday-inspiration-front-tab.html" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kM6Sgjd135A/UjIxduq4dQI/AAAAAAAAJfc/k83Bp28K7L4/s400/015-1.jpg" width="297"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Oh wait, actually maybe a denim skirt with opaque tights and boots says Autumn more. You decide. Anyways, this project might not be much quicker time-wise than a from-scratch sewing project, but by playing with the different tones and faded elements of old jeans the results are arguably more interesting! Or you could simply adopt the front tab detail from <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/refashion-friday-inspiration-front-tab.html" target="_blank">this denim skirt project</a> to add interest at at the waist, front or back, to a high-waisted garment.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2Bv94PFzo7c/UjI0OZda1QI/AAAAAAAAJfo/oak47FCMBPQ/s1600/002-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2Bv94PFzo7c/UjI0OZda1QI/AAAAAAAAJfo/oak47FCMBPQ/s400/002-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/refashion-friday-inspiration-lace-yoke.html" target="_blank">Lace Yoke Sweatshirt Dress</a> would probably be the easiest and snuggliest garment you'd find yourself wearing all season! The idea behind the remake could obviously have the lace element omitted for a more utilitarian, sporty look.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So what about you? Do you have any Autumnal (or Vernal if you live in the Southern Hemisphere) refashioning projects up your crafty sleeves?&nbsp;</div></div>
