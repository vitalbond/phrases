I'll be coming back to this topic and this company in the New Year, but in the meantime I am able to offer you a check out code that will entitle you to a free organic cotton thread when you spend over &pound;30. Valid until 31st Jan 2014, the code is: <b>SoZoLovesEco</b><br><br>So, currently I am trying to crawl commando-soldier style out of the heaven/hell of the three months since the baby-tornado landed squarely on my life. And as I metaphorically pick myself up and dust myself off, I've discovered that, lo and behold, I have a body! It's a bit of a mess, and different from the pre-preggers times with its larger, leaky boobs and its looser, slightly crinkly belly skin. But it's familiar none the less. My post-birth wardrobe now consists of three pairs of pre-pregnancy leggings/jeggings and on top I'm wearing layers of vests, jersey tops and cardigans, the combo I've found to be the easiest for 'gaining access' to breast feed without freezing. And whilst I'm pinned to the sofa feeding Dolores or being used as her bed, my thoughts often wander to my long-lost bezzie: sewing. <br><br>I'm getting a little fed up of my limited selection of clothing and am longing to add a little stylistic variety for getting out and about in. Sewing woven dresses or tops is pointless as my bust has grown and I don't want to waste precious time and fabric when I don't know what I'll be 'left with' when I stop breast feeding and deflate. I have more than enough jersey tops to keep me going even with a couple of vom-incidents (her not me, usually) each day, so there's no need to make any of those either. I can't begin to imagine ever having enough time again to spend on a large project like a coat or jacket so that leaves bottoms to consider sewing next. I wear skirts so infrequently (particularly in Winter/Spring) plus I already have some awesome ones, so I'm planning trousers. Will you help me?<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MtJbj2HrLm4/UrhVpZVEfiI/AAAAAAAAJrE/Djoaeu_2yz4/s1600/70s.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MtJbj2HrLm4/UrhVpZVEfiI/AAAAAAAAJrE/Djoaeu_2yz4/s400/70s.jpg" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i>(<a href="http://mybeaubaby.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/these-things-i-covet.html" target="_blank">Image Source</a>)</i></div><br>Over a year later, I am still lamenting the death of my black and denim pairs of sailor trousers. Plus the wide legged style would be a really different silhouette to my current be-jegginged one, so that's what we are looking at here people. So let's talk pattern-options, I'd appreciate your opinions...<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y4UPfRYIGoM/Urg9isnt3VI/AAAAAAAAJqI/YH-uul9Jmvc/s1600/8488-front-envelope.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y4UPfRYIGoM/Urg9isnt3VI/AAAAAAAAJqI/YH-uul9Jmvc/s400/8488-front-envelope.jpg" width="277"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Firstly, there's the old 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' option of using the same pattern (Burda 8488, pictured above) that I used for my previous two pairs of sailor trousers. Using this would make sense because A) I already own the pattern, B) am confident of the construction process, and C) know the fit issues. But it's a bit boring using the same pattern, isn't it?!</div><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f3RAwTbgqqM/Urg843ccDuI/AAAAAAAAJqA/J6-81W1h7hQ/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-12-23+at+13.38.06.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f3RAwTbgqqM/Urg843ccDuI/AAAAAAAAJqA/J6-81W1h7hQ/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-12-23+at+13.38.06.png" width="297"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Then there's this <a href="http://www.burdastyle.com/pattern_store/patterns/sailor-style-pants-082012" target="_blank">Sailor Style Pants pattern</a> that is available for download on the Burdastyle website, but I think I may also own the copy of the Burda mag that originally featured this pattern. I like the variation in style where the front pleats are trapped down by the buttons. I think this would look great in a fabric that has quite a bit of drape, so possibly not the most appropriate garment for a shitty Winter like the one we are currently looking down the barrel at.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cfaL9qUg73w/UrhO0KQaf_I/AAAAAAAAJqk/wouF5bh_T8A/s1600/125technical_original_large.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cfaL9qUg73w/UrhO0KQaf_I/AAAAAAAAJqk/wouF5bh_T8A/s400/125technical_original_large.jpg" width="350"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Whilst we are mining the wealth of patterns on Burdastyle, check out <a href="http://www.burdastyle.com/pattern_store/patterns/sailor-pants-042012" target="_blank">these bad boys pictured above</a>. I'm not too sure about the waistband element as those tend to give me trapped wind (TMI?! Another result of having given birth is that I no longer have any shame!) but they are mighty handsome strides, let's make no mistake! Obvs I wouldn't bother with the back pocket coz I'm a lazy-arse.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-11yUEW-SZ5E/UrhMroPoSqI/AAAAAAAAJqY/rrFrx0QIPxk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-12-23+at+14.45.28.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-11yUEW-SZ5E/UrhMroPoSqI/AAAAAAAAJqY/rrFrx0QIPxk/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-12-23+at+14.45.28.png" width="352"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And then there's the Hot Patterns <a href="http://www.hotpatterns.com/hp-1016-riviera-hello-sailor-pants/" target="_blank">Riviera Hello, Sailor! Pants pattern</a>. I like the leg shape of these but my current sewing machine does not have a one-step button hole function so I'm kind of baulking at the prospects of all those buttons!

Technically a shorts pattern, I'm sure these could be elongated with little bother. A somewhat subtler version which also has an added benefit in that I already own this pattern having bought it <i>just</i> before I became pregnant and therefore has yet to be used.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So there we have it peops, what are your thoughts? Which should I use to form the basis of my next sewing project? Has anyone used any of these and feel it could be recommended or should be avoided? Or do you know of any other sailor trousers/pants/shorts patterns that you think I should use? Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</div></div>
