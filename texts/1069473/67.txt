<div>January 2014 is already into double figures but I don't want to wave goodbye to 2013 without a little look back:<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KLBsyp-h4kc/UtBOQPJ6SuI/AAAAAAAAJrc/9SZ0TKP_vA8/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-01-10+at+19.46.44.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KLBsyp-h4kc/UtBOQPJ6SuI/AAAAAAAAJrc/9SZ0TKP_vA8/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-01-10+at+19.46.44.png" height="240" width="400"></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>(image source: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/2205993@N23/" target="_blank">Me-Made-May'13 flickr group</a>)</i></div><br><u><b>Me-Made-May '13</b></u><br><br>2013 saw the most well-subscribed, exciting and vibrant me-made/self-stitched challenge yet.

Organised by the ever-awesome <a href="http://portialawrie.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Miss P</a>, the purpose of this challenge was to bring the concept of refashioning to a wider sewing audience by asking a whole mixed bunch of talented soles to transform randomly assigned second-hand items into reworked wondrousness.

But not just any old makes, I specified that these garments had to be successful in the areas of comfort, fit and in reflecting my sense of style. These items had to become regularly worn items, not just items that get dragged out for Me-Made-May!<br><br>Regular readers of this blog will of course be aware that I spent the majority of 2013 pregnant. Before I started to show I racked up some nice makes&nbsp;all of which fit my criteria (or would have done if I'd had a chance to wear them for longer had I not started changing shape)<br><br>1)&nbsp;<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/leopard-mathilde-blouse.html" target="_blank">leopard print Mathilde blouse</a> (pictured above),<br>2)&nbsp;<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/1940s-pin-up-tea-dress.html" target="_blank">40's Tea dress</a>,<br>3)&nbsp;<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/mustard-mariniere-trousers.html" target="_blank">Mustard Marini&egrave;re trousers</a>,<br>4)&nbsp;<a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/lady-like-pussy-bow-blouse.html" target="_blank">Lady-like Pussy Bow blouse</a>,<br><br>But from April-ish onwards my pregnancy began to dominate most of my sewing activities and effected the sewlution challenge. Because the maternity garments would naturally have a limited lifespan, I wasn't so worried about accurately reflecting my sense of style and felt freer to use fabric and try styles that weren't entirely 'me'.
