This week's giveaway is open to everyone, not just #MMMay'14 participants, and you can win a sewing pattern of your choice from <a href="http://www.indiestitches.com.au/" target="_blank">Indie Stitches</a>. The giveaway is <a href="http://www.jenniferlaurenvintage.com/2014/05/me-made-may-14-giveaway-2.html" target="_blank">hosted here </a>on <a href="http://www.jenniferlaurenvintage.com/" target="_blank">Jen's blog</a> so head over there for full details.<br><br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XohRK812pqM/U2pHH8OplaI/AAAAAAAAJ7g/5ToVk9sw63c/s1600/Jedediah_Pants_1_1024x1024.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XohRK812pqM/U2pHH8OplaI/AAAAAAAAJ7g/5ToVk9sw63c/s1600/Jedediah_Pants_1_1024x1024.jpg" height="400" width="318"></a></div><br>Oh and I know you were just about to ask me, '<i>Zoe, what independent sewing pattern company's pattern would you choose, if you were allowed to enter?</i>'. On a self-less tip, I'd go for the <a href="http://www.indiestitches.com.au/collections/thread-theory/products/jedediah-pants" target="_blank">Jedediah Pants by Thread Theory</a> to make for Mr So, Zo (AKA Pat). He's recently got into creating himself a new look and has even set himself up <a href="http://gb.pinterest.com/patrick2511/strong-looks/" target="_blank">a Pinterest board</a> to help him harvest ideas (!), and I think this pattern would fit the bill.</div>
