I have run out of names for my nautical inspired creations. However I have not run out of inspiration for more nautical garments, so that's fine. I made this dress a few weeks ago, before a weekend away in Madrid. Madrid can get HOT and I realised I had nowt to wear during such temperatures that was pregnancy-friendly so a quick project sewing project was required. (Check out the pic above, that's a portrait of my grandmother painted by my grandfather in the 60's. She doesn't look that into my creation does she?!) </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_G1l8HKfWQ/UboZcjcfWCI/AAAAAAAAJJI/4dDBBZzYf2w/s1600/DSC00196-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_G1l8HKfWQ/UboZcjcfWCI/AAAAAAAAJJI/4dDBBZzYf2w/s400/DSC00196-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So first we need to talk about the epic fabric. I'm insanely lucky to be able to say that it was a gift from the phenomenally lovely Winnie from <a href="https://scruffybadgertime.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scruffy Badger Time</a>. She is such a sweetie. It's a really lovely drapey jersey with a large elastane content, making it super comfy to wear. I still have sufficient fabric left to make an adult's top or a couple of toddler/child garments, whichever I get round to first. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The pattern is yet another interpretation of <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/batwing-crazy.html" target="_blank">my own batwing top pattern</a>. Following on the success of <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/stash-bustin-peter-pan-collar-batwing.html" target="_blank">a T-shirt version</a> of this originally long-sleeved design that made for my best mate, I then simply extended the pattern down into an A-line dress shape. The sleeve bands/cuffs are made from a contrast scrap of navy and white striped jersey of a similar weight left over from <a href="http://sozowhatdoyouknow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/more-mid-maternity-stripes.html" target="_blank">my maternity stripes top</a>. This dress was constructed using an overlocker for all seams, plus my usual machine with a three-strep zigzag stitch to hem it. This dress actually took longer to cut out than to construct, got to love that ratio when you're tight on time. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A-cT9zMqiZs/Ubl9VHmHafI/AAAAAAAAJIA/udxgEhgkx_U/s1600/photo-9-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A-cT9zMqiZs/Ubl9VHmHafI/AAAAAAAAJIA/udxgEhgkx_U/s400/photo-9-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Look! It's me and my mate Anna (who lives in Madrid) with our bumps! Jersey-based success! This may be the most comfortable garment I have ever made, and certainly the most comfortable maternity garment I own. I wore it two days straight in Madrid and it even saw a bit of use back in UK before the sun decided to piss off again and Summer was replaced with clouds and rain. I managed to get ice cream down the front though, which I see as a victory. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4s75Ae1h3Hw/Ubl9ZxbnEuI/AAAAAAAAJII/c6ePdFuC_lc/s1600/photo-8-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4s75Ae1h3Hw/Ubl9ZxbnEuI/AAAAAAAAJII/c6ePdFuC_lc/s400/photo-8-1.jpg" width="300"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></div>If I had to split hairs and find a flaw with this creation, I'd say that I made the sleeve bands/cuffs a little too loose. If I could be arsed to unpick, recut and reattach them then the gathered effect of the sleeves would be a bit more apparent, however I can't so it is what it is. As with all successful and speedy creations, I'm now tempted ti make a whole heap more using any pieces of similar weight jersey in my stash. However the UK weather has shown that, due to the fact that I have literally only worn this once since returning from Madrid, making a pile more of these dresses would probably be a waste of fabric. Still, I am confident that it'll see post-pregnancy use too, possibly with a bit of skimming in at the side seams at some point (although maybe not!).</div>
