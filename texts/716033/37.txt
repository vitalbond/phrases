<p>I am often approached by parents, business owners, and stakeholders of Holy Cross about programs they wish to see implemented in our school. Many of these programs have great merit. As I review these ideas, my main concern is protecting academic time. As educators, we work diligently to protect the precious minutes we have with your children, so they are exposed to the best education possible.</p>
<p>It is important for students to arrive to school on time each day. Establishing a habit of being prompt will not only impact the student today, but will provide the framework for a life skill that will impact them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The first bell for the school day rings at 7:50 a.m. School officially begins at 8:00 a.m. Please give your children a gift by ensuring they arrive on time every day. Being even a few minutes late sets them behind their peers, and often negatively impacts their schooling for the rest of the day. Additionally, students entering the classroom late cause disruption for all learners in the room.</p>
<p>Who needs &ldquo;Jazz in the Woods&rdquo; when you can hear the newly formed Holy Cross Jazz Band? Twenty-seven budding jazz musicians arrive early every Thursday morning to learn the skills of jazz music under the direction of our famous teacher, Melissa Cain. I enjoy the sounds of jazz music early on Thursday, and I look forward to their first performance.</p>
<p>Taco/Bingo Night is tonight in the gym. You can purchase tickets at the door for $7.00 for adults and $3.00 for children. Support the Holy Cross 8th Grade Graduation Fund by attending. The evening begins at 6:00.</p>
