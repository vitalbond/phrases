The following is the winning article, by 8th grader Devin Palmer&hellip;</span></span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Candy Canes, Baby Jesus and&hellip; Christmas Sweaters?</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">What does Christmas mean to you? </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">Ask a child and get an hour long description of their favorite hot cocoa recipe, all the presents they absolutely <i>need</i> for Christmas and their record for most candy canes eaten in ten minutes. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">Ask an adult and they&rsquo;ll give a list of all their favorite family traditions, how stressed they are about having the whole family over and how their children can eat more than 26 candy canes in under ten minutes. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">Shouldn&rsquo;t Christmas mean a little bit more than that? Christmas is not solely about who can down the most eggnog or fit the most fruitcake in her mouth, it has a little bit more to do with that whole giving/receiving stuff.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">Think about it, Christmas could just as easily be called Jesus Day. God was born on Christmas <span style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span> it was Christmas. There were no candy canes, Santa hadn&rsquo;t even been born yet. It was just a very pregnant Mary, a very nervous father-to-be and a lot of animals, who are all very grateful that they are about to <i>receive</i> a beautiful son, who &ndash;oh by the way- will bring eternal peace and joy to the whole world.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">We need to be grateful for that, too. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m totally thankful for candy canes and Christmas cookies (seriously thankful), but that same baby from that stable more than 2000 years ago is the reason we&rsquo;re here. So this holiday let&rsquo;s be a little more &ldquo;Wow, Great-Aunt Marge, thanks for spending your time to make me a gift!&rdquo; instead of your usual sarcasm: &ldquo;Gee, Great-Aunt Marge, another hand-knitted sweater?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:small;">Now go crank up your favorite Christmas jam, eat some fruitcake and have a happy <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Christmas</span> Jesus Day.</span></span></p>
