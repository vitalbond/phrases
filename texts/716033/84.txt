<div><p>Today is field day at Holy Cross School and it is a full out of uniform day. &nbsp;Hopefully the weather will allow for some good outdoor fun!</p>
<p>Also the End of the Year Picnic is this evening as well. &nbsp;Parking will be available in the preschool parking lot, the Greek Church parking lot of the Baptist church parking lot. &nbsp;The parking lot behind the school will be NOT be used for parking as that is where we the picnic will be held.</p>
<p>Please remember to bring a side dish to share and drinks for your family. &nbsp;If the weather does not allow us all to be outside we will move the picnic to the gym.</p>
