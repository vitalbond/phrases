<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">Dear Parents,<a href="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hcnewsletter-140213.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1680" style="border:0 none;margin:10px;" title="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" alt="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" src="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nutshell.jpg?w=111&amp;h=121" width="111" height="121"></span></a></span></p>
<p>The teachers and staff at Holy Cross participate in on-going professional development, meeting for half days at least once per month. The safety of our students has been a primary focus during several of these sessions. The reality of today&rsquo;s culture demands that we prepare students and staff for the unlikely event of a security issue. On February 28, with the cooperation of the Overland Park Police Department, Holy Cross School will hold a &ldquo;lockdown, lights-out&rdquo; drill. The teachers and staff have been speaking with the students about proper procedures during these situations. We will make a concerted effort to keep these conversations age-appropriate so as not to cause undue anxiety around this drill.</p>
<p>I would like to invite you to a very special presentation that will explore the common and uncommon causes of dangers in schools, and answer the question, &ldquo;What are we doing to reduce the risks at Holy Cross?&rdquo; Topics will include crisis planning, physical security, intervention on the path to violence, effective lockdowns and more.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, February 26, 2013</strong><br><strong>7:00 p.m. in Pflumm Hall</strong><br><strong>Presenter: Dan Carney</strong><br><strong>26-year veteran of the Overland Park Police Department</strong><br><strong>Currently the director of Safety and Security for Blue Valley School District</strong></p>
<p>If you drive by Holy Cross School early on Tuesday mornings, you might notice a special group of students arriving well before the school day begins. These students from all grades (even Kindergarten) are here for Chess Club, a new and exciting gathering of young people who all share an interest in one of the world&rsquo;s oldest games. Since January, two coaches from the Midwest Chess Club have been working with our students. They have expressed their appreciation for our students&rsquo; enthusiasm<br>
and dedication to this great game.</p>
<p>Fr. Mark Mertes, former pastor of Holy Cross, visited Vocation Club students on Tuesday. He shared his vocation story, and answered questions about the priesthood. Father also led a sing-a-long, bringing back wonderful memories of students singing Pharoah, Pharoah, Deep and Wide, and The Fruits of the Spirit. We are blessed at Holy Cross with a wonderful spiritual leader in our pastor, Father Mike Stubbs, as well as the gift of our previous pastors.</p>
