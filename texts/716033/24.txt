<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">Dear Parents,<a href="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hcnewsletter-140131.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1680" style="border:0 none;margin:10px;" title="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" alt="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" src="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nutshell.jpg?w=111&amp;h=121" width="111" height="121"></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">This morning, I was listening to music as I was getting ready for work. Angels Among Us by Alabama was playing, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about the wonderful community of Holy Cross Catholic School.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>&ldquo;I believe there are angels among us, sent down to us from somewhere up above. . . to show us how to live, to teach how to give, and guide us with a light of love.&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mere words can&rsquo;t express our true appreciation for the love, support, and prayers we receive from this faith-filled community. We are blessed to share in the lives of our amazing students and parents. God is great!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Students from school are leading the 9:00 and 11:00 masses at church this Sunday. All students are asked to wear their school uniforms in support of our school. I hope to see you all there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Conferences are scheduled for February 13, 2014. Your child&rsquo;s teacher will send a note requesting a conference if necessary. You will sign up utilizing Sign up Genius. Mrs. Beisser will send an email through Sign up Genius on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Celebration was fantastic. Thanks to everyone for supporting our parish and school community by donating your time, talent, and treasure to this spectacular event. During Celebration, funds were raised to repair the school gym. There are several holes in the floor that need attention. In addition, the gym floor needs to be stripped, sanded, and re-stained. We are still accepting donations for this cause. If you were not able to attend Celebration, but would like to contribute, please send a check to the school office payable to Holy Cross Celebration. Write the words &ldquo;Fund-a-Need&rdquo; on the memo line.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Have a wonderful weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">God bless,</span></p>
