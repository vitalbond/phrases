<p>March Madness has arrived. As much as I love basketball, I am not speaking of the NCAA Tournament. March Madness at Holy Cross is the time when the teachers and staff realize the fourth quarter of the school year is fast approaching. Teachers are working diligently planning lessons, preparing for state assessments, and providing students with opportunities for Lenten reflection.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I observed Mrs. Wagner&rsquo;s kindergarten class during morning activities. Mrs. Wagner asked the students if they wanted to share their Lenten promises. Some decided to keep theirs private, while others were eager to share. Below is a list of the few I remembered:</p>
<ul><li>I will stop being mean to my brother.</li>
<li>I will be nice to everyone.</li>
<li>I will clean my room when asked.</li>
<li>I will eat all my food at dinner.</li>
<li>I will be nice to my dad.</li>
<li>I will take care of my little dog.</li>
<li>I will be nice to my family and pray every day.</li>
</ul><p>As I listened, I thought, &ldquo;How cute! Their promises are so innocent.&rdquo; But as I reflected, I realized that those innocent statements are words of true wisdom. I need to do all those things. Out of the mouth of babes, I heard a recipe for a faith-filled Lenten journey.</p>
<p>Hank Sheeley, an 8th grade student, is spearheading a basic necessities drive. Imagine not having soap, toothpaste, toilet paper, deodorant, and other personal care items. Giving the Basics provide these items to those in need. There are collection barrels in the front hall, primary hall, and near the gym. Please take some time this weekend and purchase one or two items to give to the less fortunate. This is a great Lenten opportunity for the family. Barrels will be in place until Wednesday, March 12th. More information regarding needed items is in the newsletter. Thank you, Hank, for being a great steward and providing our community with this opportunity to give.</p>
<p>God bless,</p>
