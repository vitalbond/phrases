<div><p><span style="color:#333333;">Today&rsquo;s theme for Catholic Schools Week at Holy Cross was<span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong> 80s Workout Day</strong></span>. Lots of hair scrunchies, ripped shirts and leg warmers were found roaming the halls!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Today&rsquo;s theme honors St. Joseph, who is known as the hard worker. He spent his life working and caring for the Blessed Mother and her son, Jesus, with a smile on his face. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Tomorrow is Spirit Day, so dress the kids in Holy Cross blue and gold!</strong> The day honors St. Thomas Aquinas, the patron saint of students. He was a scholar and now a doctor of the church. On Thursday, Holy Cross will remember St. Thomas Aquinas and his great teachings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Thursday is also the day for Mission Carnival, a fun annual fundraiser put together by the 8th grade class.</span><strong><span style="color:#333333;"> Remember to send lunch in a paper sack with a bottle of water with your student(s) tomorrow!</span></strong></p>
