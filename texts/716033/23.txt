<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">Today the Holy Cross 8th grade class organized and presented the annual Mission Carnival. From a hamster ball and inflatable slide to ring toss and dj music, Holy Cross students and preschoolers enjoyed a day of fun and fundraising. The 8th graders created a haunted hallway, painted faces and provided the student body many ways to enjoy themselves. Thanks to all who participated. Stay tuned for a future blog post with the total amount raised and which charities the 8th grade chose to support with the proceeds.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Tomorrow is Sports Day for the theme, so your student can wear athletic wear of their choice.&nbsp; The day honors St. Sebastian, patron saint of sports and athletes. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Here are some photos from Mission Carnival Day at Holy Cross.<br></span>p.s. Word is that there is video of Principal Carney in the hamster ball! We&rsquo;ll post it soon.</p>
