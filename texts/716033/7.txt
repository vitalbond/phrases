<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">Dear Parents,</span></p>
<p>Happy New Year! It is great to be Catholic this time of year. Most of my neighbors took down their Christmas trees and turned off their Christmas lights a day or two after Christmas day. I enjoyed the peacefulness of the Octave of Christmas with my tree shining brightly in the living room, and Christmas carols playing as I make dinner and complete the puzzle I received from Santa. <a href="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/hcnewsletter-140110.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1680" style="border:0 none;margin:10px;" title="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" alt="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" src="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nutshell.jpg?w=82&amp;h=90" width="82" height="90"></a>Celebrating Christmas without the hustle and bustle of the secular world pushing the newest toy or gadget has been a great joy that Catholics can experience each year.</p>
<p>I have never been very good at New Year Resolutions. Last week I came across this list of New Year&rsquo;s resolutions written by Pope Francis. My goal is to follow these resolutions in 2014. I challenge you to take this journey with me as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1. Don&rsquo;t gossip.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2. Finish your meals.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">3. Make time for others.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">4. Choose the more humble purchase.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">5. Meet the poor &ldquo;in the flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">6. Stop judging others.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">7. Befriend those who disagree.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">8. Make commitments.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">9. Make it a habit to &ldquo;ask the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">10. Be happy.</p>
<p>Imagine how much our community would grow in Christ if we followed this list.</p>
<p>Celebration 2014 will be upon us in a little over two short weeks. We are 200 items short of our usual donations. We ask that each family consider their stewardship of donating to this once a year fundraiser for Holy Cross. If you do not know what to give, please grab a leaf off the giving tree in the narthex and purchase or solicit the item printed on it. Don&rsquo;t forget to grab your donation form before you leave the church or school. If you are a shopper, please go look for the bargains! We are looking for items to go into Men&rsquo;s Club, Religious &amp; Holiday and Electronics. Remember you can solicit your local shopping venues for donations. Donation forms can be located at church and/or school office.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">God bless,</span></p>
