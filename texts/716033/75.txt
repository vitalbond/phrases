<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">The Box Tops shown below are just a few of the expired Box Tops we&rsquo;ve received this year. These could have translated into more than $300 for Holy Cross School if we were able to send them in before their expiration date. (Yes, they check. We can&rsquo;t send them in if they&rsquo;re expired.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The moral of the story &ndash; if you&rsquo;re collecting Box Tops at home, don&rsquo;t hoard them. Don&rsquo;t let them just accumulate in your kitchen.&nbsp; Drop them off at the school or church today!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Thanks for your help in raising funds for the Guardian Angel Tuition Assistance Fund at Holy Cross by clipping and collecting Box Tops, Labels for Education and Best Choice UPCs.</span></p>
