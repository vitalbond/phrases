<p>On Tuesday, twenty-four students entered the world of Chess. Coach W and Coach Jason from Midwest Chess Academy were impressed with our polite, eager students, and the willingness to try a new activity. I am looking forward to watching the group grow in their knowledge and ability.</p>
<p>Jazz Band has arrived at Holy Cross. Twenty-six students arrived early on Thursday for the first day of Jazz Band practice. It was great walking in the building and hearing the joyful sounds of the horns filling the halls so early. Way to go Jazz Band and Mrs. Cain. I am impressed with your dedication to music.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Latino Families of Holy Cross for sponsoring our first annual tamale sale. The tamales were delicious. I am excited about having this sale as an annual event at Holy Cross.</p>
<p>Catholic School&rsquo;s Week is next week. The student council has finalized the list of out of uniform days for next week. They are in this newsletter. One component of Catholic School&rsquo;s Week is the Mission Carnival sponsored by the 8th grade. The carnival is a fun way to celebrate our school while raising funds for those in need. Parents are welcomed to attend the carnival. Additional information is in the newsletter.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at Celebration on Saturday.</p>
