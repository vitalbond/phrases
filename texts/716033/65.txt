<div><p><em>from Holy Cross art teacher, Mr. Long -</em></p>
<p>The Holy Cross 8th grade Specials art class this year focused on ancient art and methods. We used two of the oldest methods of creating vessels known &ndash; coiling clay and coiling with fibers.</p>
<p>Originally, coiled fiber pots were made from prairie grasses, ours were made with modern materials such as paper and yarn. Other than that, the methods are the same. As you can see from the examples below, the 8th grade did a fantastic job with their creations.</p>
