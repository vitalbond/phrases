<div><p><span style="color:#333333;">Dear Parents,<a href="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hcnewsletter-140312.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#333333;"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1680" style="border:0 none;margin:10px;" title="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" alt="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" src="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nutshell.jpg?w=111&amp;h=121" width="111" height="121"></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">The 6th grade students in Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. Anderson&rsquo;s class created an Ancient Greece Museum in Mrs. Lewis&rsquo;s classroom. The sixth graders have worked very hard to build a wonderful experience for all students. If you are in the building today, feel free to stop by and visit. Thank you to Mrs. Lewis for her hard work in providing this wonderful learning environment for her students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Many of the eighth grade students heard a presentation from Ms. Neta of MOSCA about treating others with respect, and not judging others by their appearance. They learned the importance of not following the secular world&rsquo;s description of the perfect man and perfect woman. Students learned they would meet many different people as they enter the world of high school, and that as Catholic students they are called to treat everyone with love and kindness. It was a lovely presentation, and it tied in nicely with their lessons in Theology of the Body.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s third grade class studied Ireland this week. The lessons culminated in creating a traditional Irish feast. Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien and her students put their culinary skills to work and made a delicious Irish stew. The meal also included Irish soda bread. It was delicious!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">PTO is planning our first Annual Holy Cross Rummage Sale slated for May 30th and 31st in the school gym. As you spend time spring-cleaning this year, please consider saving your gently used items for our sale. At this time, we cannot store your items. Please share with your friends. Large item pick up is available during the week preceding the sale. The Rummage Sale proceeds will benefit new Social Studies instructional resources, and help support technology upgrades.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Please consider volunteering time to help our CYO track team. Many students are excited about participating, but the team needs volunteer parents. Contact Mr. Fournier if you are interested in helping with practices or meets.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Report cards for the third quarter will be sent home on Monday, March 24th.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Have a wonderful Spring Break.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">God bless,</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong></span><br><span style="color:#333333;"> Students gather every last Monday of the month in the gym to pray the rosary. It is a lovely, prayerful time together as a school. In April, we will pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet. We welcome parents to join us.</span><br><span style="color:#333333;"> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
