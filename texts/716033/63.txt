<p><span style="color:#333333;">The Holy Cross bands performed at the St. Cecilia Band Festival hosted by Saint Thomas Aquinas Wednesday night.&nbsp; Ten bands from six different schools from the Archdiocese had the opportunity to perform two songs for the other schools. &nbsp;We ended the concert with one mass band piece called &ldquo;Freedom Finale.&rdquo; &nbsp;The Holy Cross bands represented their school in a great way. &nbsp;</span></p>
