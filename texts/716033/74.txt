<p><span style="color:#000000;">Holy Cross School second graders and religious education students from the parish gathered recently in a retreat to prepare for their first communion. All will be receiving first communion during regular mass times the three weekends following Easter weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Keep them in your prayers as they mark this important rite of passage and prepare to receive Jesus in the Holy Eucharist.</span></p>
