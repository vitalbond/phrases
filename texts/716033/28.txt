<div><p><span style="color:#333333;">Thanks to all who attended and/or worked to make our Holy Cross annual parish fundraiser, Celebration, a great success!&nbsp; Not only did everybody seem to have a fun time, a lot of money was raised for the parish.&nbsp; The fund-a-need auction item, in particular, raised $30,000. The money will primarily be used to fix the school gym floor. There are several holes in the floor that need attention. In addition, the entire floor needs to be stripped, sanded, and re-stained.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Thanks to all who contributed. If you would still like to make a donation, please send a check to the school office, payable to Holy Cross Celebration. Write the words &ldquo;Fund-a-Need&rdquo; on the memo line.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Here are a few pictures from the night. Find many more on the Holy Cross photo gallery @ <a href="http://holycrossop.shutterfly.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#333333;">holycrossop.shutterfly.com</span></a> (password = <strong>holycrossop</strong>).&nbsp; Thank you to Holy Cross parishioner Mark Stuecheli for the photos!</span></p>
