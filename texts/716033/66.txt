<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you didn&rsquo;t make it to Oak Park Mall to the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore on Saturday, you missed the music, art and fun of the Holy Cross bookfair day, BUT you haven&rsquo;t missed your chance to help Holy Cross raise money from the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Buy from any area Barnes &amp; Noble or online from B&amp;N.com using the code <strong>11330172</strong> at checkout through Thursday, April 10, and 15-20% of your purchase benefits the Holy Cross school library. (free shipping with orders over $25 online)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Thanks to Mrs. Cain and the Holy Cross 5th and 6th grade bands for performing on Saturday. You sounded great. The student art displayed at the bookstore looked beautiful.&nbsp; Thanks to the volunteers who manned the welcome table and the craft table. And thanks to all who attended to support Holy Cross!</span></p>
