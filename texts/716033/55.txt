<p>Holy Cross 6th graders just completed a 3rd quarter Ancient Greece unit learning about the culture, geographical features, history, government, and religion.&nbsp; Students wrote essays, created maps and timelines. Each student was also responsible for developing three projects to display in a Greek museum which was open on the Wednesday before Spring Break for K-8 classroom visits.</p>
