<p><span style="color:#333333;">Do you know what a chordophone is? How about a aerophone? &nbsp;Well, Holy Cross 4th graders sure do! &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">After students learned the classifications of each type of instrument, they were challenged to make their own kind of instrument. &nbsp;With instruments with names like the &ldquo;Legit Drum 2000&Prime;, &ldquo;Trasher&rdquo; and Combustion Drum&rdquo;, we could definitely have a Holy Cross STOMP group. The students had a great time making instruments out of everyday materials such as coffee cans, gift wrap rollers, fishing line, buckets, and more.</span></p>
