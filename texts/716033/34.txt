We raised $163 in January, but we&rsquo;d like to raise about 4 times that much in February. Hopefully you were just hanging onto them at home. OK, now it&rsquo;s time to send them in to school. Mr. Wagner&rsquo;s 7th graders are in the lead at this point in the competition &ndash; are you going to let them enjoy the cookies and victory of claiming the Box Tops trophy at the end of February?!</span></div>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">We&rsquo;ve raised $1,780 so far for the school year, and we&rsquo;re a little more than halfway to our goal of $3,300. We&rsquo;re also well more than halfway through the school year, so we need to step up the collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><em><a href="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/feb-boxtops.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#333333;">Click here to download a collections sheet, if you prefer to send them in that way</span></a>.&nbsp;</em> We&rsquo;re happy to get them any way you send them &ndash; in a bag, on a sheet, clipped, unclipped. Just send them. Thanks!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Box Tops for the Jan/Feb contest will be picked up from the classrooms on Wednesday, Feb. 26. Please send in your collections by then.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">It will take help from everyone to make it to our goal! Every Box Top helps.<br></span></p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/holycrosscatholicschool.wordpress.com/10534/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/holycrosscatholicschool.wordpress.com/10534/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=holycrosscatholicschool.wordpress.com&amp;blog=4224641&amp;post=10534&amp;subd=holycrosscatholicschool&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1"></div>
