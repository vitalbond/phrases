<p><span style="color:#333333;">Holy Cross 8th graders voted to send the proceeds from the Mission Carnival they hosted in February to Father Bob Conroy&rsquo;s Mission in Guatemala.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Fr. Bob and his fellow missionary priests currently are feeding over 300 children a day who otherwise would go hungry. He has been working with the local government to secure a place to establish a food kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">The 8th graders remember the year that Fr. Bob was with us at Holy Cross and wanted to help his cause for establishing a food kitchen. They recalled how he visited their classrooms and shared his life as a Missionary of Charity priest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">After our expenses for the large inflatables that were in the gym and some odds/ends carnival supplies, the 8th grade class of 2014 will be donating about $625.00 to Fr. Bob&rsquo;s Guatemala Mission.</span></p>
