<div><p><span style="color:#333333;">Thanks to all who came out for taco dinner and a fun time at bingo at <strong>Family Fun Night</strong> last Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">The evening was great fun, and a successful fundraiser for the 8th grade class&rsquo; graduation fund. The money will help support the graduation brunch, a class outing and the class gift that the 8th graders will leave with the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">If you missed this year&rsquo;s Family Fun Night / Taco-Bingo Night, never fear. It&rsquo;s an annual fundraiser, and our current Holy Cross 7th graders and their parents will be hosting it next year!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Here a few pictures from the event. There are more pictures in the Holy Cross photo gallery at <a href="http://holycrossop.shutterfly.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#333333;">holycrossop.shutterfly.com</span></a> (password = <strong>holycrossop</strong>).</span></p>
