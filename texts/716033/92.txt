<div><p><span style="color:#222222;">Holy Cross gives tribute to Blessed Mother Mary through prayer and song each year at the school&rsquo;s May Crowning service. The eighth grade class leads the service, including a human rosary that is created by students from all grades at the school. A special crowning court is picked from 8th graders who wrote essays on the Blessed Mother&rsquo;s role in their lives. Claire Deschamp was chosen to crown the large Blessed Virgin Mary statue this year during the service, with Rachel Siurek as her attendant.</span><span style="color:#222222;">&nbsp;The eighth graders also acknowledge their own mothers and grandmothers the service.</span></p>
