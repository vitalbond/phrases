<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">The school week ended with an assembly at Holy Cross to celebrate Catholic Schools Week. In addition to some spirited dodgeball competition between students and teachers, it was a time to remember what a strong, close and loving community we have at Holy Cross. <em>(photos below &ndash; thanks to Holy Cross mom, Mrs. Roberts, for all the pix this week!)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The real wrap-up to Catholic Schools Week comes tomorrow (on Sunday) when our students help lead the 9 and 11 a.m. masses at church. (Make sure to have them wear their uniforms.) After church, head over to the school for breakfast made by the Knights of Columbus. We&rsquo;ll hold our annual Open House from 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 1:00 p.m. (the preschool will be open for tours 9:30 &ndash; 1.)&nbsp; Bring some neighbors or friends who you think might like to see the great things we&rsquo;ve got going on at Holy Cross School!</span></p>
