<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">Holy Cross students gathered to make joyful noise together last week at the annual Spring Concert. The concert included performances by the 5th grade band, 6th grade band, junior high band, jazz band, 5th grade, 6th grade and junior high vocal choirs, junior high bell choir and drama class, along with several solo and small group highlights.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">This was the concert debut of our new Holy Cross Jazzy Hornets jazz band. And they sounded great!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The big finale of the show featured all of the students in grades 5 through 8 gathering to sing &lsquo;I Need You To Survive&rsquo; by Frazier.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Thanks to our music director Mrs. Cain, junior high choir director Mrs. Kincaid, drama director Ms. Marx, and the accompianists and other helpers who made this night possible.</span></p>
