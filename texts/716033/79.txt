<p>What a beautiful afternoon it turned out to be between storms on Saturday. A great day for an egg hunt!</p>
<p>There were approx 100 children who attended the 2nd Annual Easter Egg Hunt at Holy Cross.&nbsp; There was fun and fellowship as children hunted for colorful eggs full of candy in the school yard and parents visited with each other. &nbsp;Children also spent time in the kindergarten classrooms where they enjoyed Easter crafts, coloring and a sticker book.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Jesus G., Billy H, Kristen H. and Jason H. for hiding the eggs for this event.</p>
