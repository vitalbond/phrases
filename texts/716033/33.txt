<div><p><em>from Holy Cross music director, Mrs. Cain -</em></p>
<p>Holy Cross third graders attended The Kansas City Symphony&rsquo;s KinderKonzert: Symphonic Citizenship on Wednesday, February 12 at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Through music we explored traits that make good citizens and build strong communities including teamwork, sharing, and following directions. The students loved seeing all of the wonderful instruments including the harp, french horn, cellos and more. &nbsp;We especially enjoyed hearing the organ being played.</p>
<p>Did you know there are over 5,000 pipes that make up the organ at the Kauffman Center? &nbsp;The biggest pipe is over 35 feet and the smallest and is as big as your pinkie finger!! &nbsp;We had a great time!!</p>
