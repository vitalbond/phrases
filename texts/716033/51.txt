<div><p><em>from Holy Cross 5th grade teacher, Mrs. Kroge -</em></p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to visit a planet named Candillamadingdong, made up of chocolate and mints?</p>
<p>Or you could travel to space to visit Matonics, which is a planet where bass clefs sing all day long?</p>
<p>Holy Cross fifth-grade students had to design their own planet for a recent project. They came up with the seasons for the planets, an atmosphere, physical features, and so much more!</p>
