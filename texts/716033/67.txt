<p><span style="color:#000000;">Holy Cross parish 8th graders recently presented a service fair at the church after masses. The students, either alone or in small groups, worked on service projects as part of their confirmation program. They chose a local organization and spent time there, learning about the group&rsquo;s mission and helping them out. They put together display boards and wrote a paper, explaining which organization they picked and how they benefit the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The service fair was an opportunity for all our Holy Cross confirmation students to show their work and to share the lessons they&rsquo;d learned from this service experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Thank you to our Holy Cross Director of Youth Ministries and Confirmation Coordinator, Sandy Schluter, for the work she has done preparing our students for confirmation.</span></p>
