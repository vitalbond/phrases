<div><p>Dear Parents,<a href="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hcnewsletter-140328.pdf"><img class="alignright wp-image-1680 size-none" src="http://holycrosscatholicschool.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nutshell.jpg?w=111&amp;h=121" alt="Holy Cross newsletter in a nutshell" width="111" height="121"></a></p>
<p>I hope to see you all at the PTO Fish Fry this evening. Mr. and Mrs. Schneider have worked hard planning a great evening of fish, friends, and fellowship. Word on the street is that the Kansas City Star will be here collecting information for a story they are writing.</p>
<p>Kansas Assessments begin next week for students in third through eighth grades. The assessment schedule will be emailed to you. Please be sure your child has a good breakfast and plenty of sleep in preparation for testing. Also, we request you schedule doctor&rsquo;s appointments around the assessment schedule.</p>
<p>Students in 2nd through 8th grade will have the opportunity to go to Confession on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. Because of time, we cannot have parents join us for these services. Confessions are heard at Holy Cross Church on Wednesdays from 6:00 &ndash; 7:00 and on Saturdays from 3:30 &ndash; 4:30 p.m. Also, there is a communal reconciliation service on Monday, April 7th at 7:00 p.m. at the church.</p>
<p>As you prepare for summer activities, I want you to know that several teachers are preparing summer enrichment classes to be offered at Holy Cross. Course information will be coming soon.</p>
<p>Please remember, we are scheduled to be in school all day on Holy Thursday this year. After School Care will be open until 6:00 p.m. that day. Also, After School Care is open on April 22nd for a full day.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about our second major fundraiser, a garage sale, scheduled for May 30 and 31. More details will be coming soon.</p>
