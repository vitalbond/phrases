<div><p><em>info &amp; pix from Holy Cross 3rd grade teacher, Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien -</em></p>
<p>The assignment for Holy Cross 3rd graders last week wasn&rsquo;t the normal &lsquo;what I did on my Spring Break&rsquo; paper. No, their teacher, Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien, was the one who enjoyed a fun trip to Florida! And she brought back with her a collection of shells she found on the beach.</p>
<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s students got to pick out shells to use in some special language projects, which included descriptive writing and then writing stories about the shells using personification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien brought back shells,&rdquo; wrote one student. &ldquo;We got to pick some. I picked a sand dollar, scallop shell, and a clam shell, and a conch shell, and a kork screw. There was a shell in my conch shell&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students measured, drew and described their shell treasures. A few examples of the descriptive papers are featured below. Now the class is on to the personification portion of the project.</p>
<p>Fun assignment, Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien!</p>
