<div><p><span style="color:#000000;">We&rsquo;re doing great with our Box Tops collections at Holy Cross this year. Let&rsquo;s push a little harder and make our goal for the school year &ndash; $3,300!</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As of the end of December, we&rsquo;re at $1,570 raised this school year.</strong> If we consider that to be halfway through the year, we&rsquo;re ahead of last year when we raised our highest amount ever &ndash; $2,853. It is not quite halfway to our $3,300 goal, so clip, clip, clip. We&rsquo;re close!</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>We have our December winning class &ndash; Mrs. Schnell&rsquo;s 8th graders</strong> will be enjoying cookies this week, and they&rsquo;ll display the Box Tops traveling trophy for the next month. Great job. A special mention must be made for Ms. Spaniol&rsquo;s class. They collected a large amount also, but fewer per student, which is how we determine the winning class.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>We&rsquo;ll combine our January and February collections to pick the first winners of 2014.</strong> So, you&rsquo;ve got time to send in those Box Tops. We&rsquo;ll pick up the January Box Tops on Feb. 3 to get a start on the counting, but final count for the contest will come at the end of February.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Two classrooms are neck-in-neck as top collectors of the year</strong> &ndash; Ms. Spaniol&rsquo;s 2nd graders have collected 1,202 and Mrs. Anderson&rsquo;s 6th graders have brought in 1,209. Let&rsquo;s see who else can pass that 1,000 mark by the end of February!</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Box Tops recently sent the school a check for $2,045</strong> for money raised March 1 &ndash; October 31, 2013. That money will go to the Guardian Fund. Let&rsquo;s keep those checks coming.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span style="color:#333333;">It will take participation from our whole school and parish family in order to meet our $3,300 goal this year. But it is definitely within reach. <strong>If you&rsquo;re a Box Tops clipper, thank you! Could you ask one more friend, neighbor or co-worker to help? If you&rsquo;ve never clipped them, could you find just one Box Top to send in to school this month?</strong> You&rsquo;ll be amazed just how easy it is.</span></li>

We&rsquo;ll take them however we can get them.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Did you know that Box Tops expire?</strong> Don&rsquo;t let them just sit and collect dust &ndash; send them into school!</span></li>
